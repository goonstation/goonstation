	<p>By now you probably know how ghost critters work. But just to reiterate:</p>

	<p>Well, first, you should treat this as a new life. This means you shouldn't hold grudges from your previous one.<p>

	<p>Second, you shouldn't be attacking any humans unless in self defense, because that's pretty mean! Rivalries or feuds with other ghost critters are fine, of course.</p>

	<p>Third, and hopefully the most obvious, you <b>are not an antag</b> and should not act like one. That means you shouldn't do anything too disruptive or something that would be considered as grief.</p>

	<p><b>Mentor mouse specific stuff:</b></p>

	<p>People can click on you to put you in their pocket. While there you can speak to them to give them advice. Treat this as if you were answering mentorhelps, the same rules apply.</p>

	<p>While in a person's pocket you can also ctrl+click on stuff on their screen to show them where something is!</p>

	<p>When in someone's pocket they can use F3 to whisper directly to you (it takes precedence over mentorhelp).</p>

	<p>When you're running around you can click on people to remind them that they can pick you up. While in a person's pocket they can make you leave by clicking the mentor mouse status effect. You can also leave voluntarily by pressing a movement key.</p>

	<p>These functions all exist for you to help players. Please do not use them for other purposes, treat everything as if you were answering a mentorhelp.</p>
