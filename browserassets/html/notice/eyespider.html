    <h1 class="center">You have reawakened to serve your host changeling!</h1>
    <p>You must <em>obey</em> their commands!<br>You are a very small and weak creature that can fit into tight spaces, and see through walls. You cannot fight, and should run from combat. You are still connected to the hivemind.</p>
    <p>
		Abilities
		<span class="small indent">
			<em>Passive X-Ray Vision</em> allows you to see through walls and hunt down targets for the collective.<br>
			<em>Blood Boil</em> to generate intense heat using all of your remaining energy and explode, scalding nearby targets. <br>
      <em>Shed Tears</em> to drop enough fluid to form a slick puddle, slipping people that cross over it. <br>
      <em>Mark</em> a potential target to be always know where they are, although you can only mark one individual at a time and marks expire after some time. <br>
      <em>Your master can return you</em> by grabbing you. This will remove your mark from your target and restore their eyes if they're missing any. <br>
