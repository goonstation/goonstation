	<p>This is <em>not</em> the end, you are now a part of the changeling hivemind.</p>

	<p>As a member of the hivemind, you can assist your master in a variety of ways:</p>
	<span class="small indent">
		<p><em>Talk</em> to them, giving them any information that might further their goals.</p>
		<p><em>Point</em> things out to them, only your master and other hivemind members can see your points.</p>
		<p class="image-right"><em>Be animated</em> as a sentient body part.<img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/handspider.png")}}" class="right" /></p>
		<p><em>Spit acid</em> by clicking while your master is in horror form.</p>
	</span>
	<p>You may exit the hivemind and return to ghost form by using the "Exit hivemind" command under the commands tab at the top right of your screen.</p>
