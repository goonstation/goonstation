	<p>
		1. <em>Your goal</em> is to establish a forward base with your <em>fellow infiltrators</em>, and to build a <em>portal generator</em> to start the invasion.
	</p>

	<p>
		2. By <em>speaking normally</em> your thoughts will carry to all other martians through the collective psionic link you all share.
		Humans <em>will not understand you</em>, and you <em>cannot understand them</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		3. All of your structures will at some point require <em>biomatter</em> to function.<br>
		This is obtained via the <em>biomass pool</em>. Compatible objects must be dipped into it to be converted into biomatter.<br>
		The list of compatible objects includes human bodies (alive or dead), monkeys (which are not as good as humans), and other things. If it's meat, it's a meal.
	</p>

	<p>
		4. Use the <em>seed grower</em> to grow more seeds after you have sufficient biomass.<br>
		It will describe what is available, what function it performs, and how much it costs to produce.
		Produced seeds <em>must be used in-hand</em> (or in-tentacle) to be activated, and then placed on an empty floor tile to begin growing.
	</p>

	<p>
		5. This is all heavily a work in progress, so no other documentation exists while things are in rapid fluctation.<br>
		Good luck, and remember that mentorhelp and adminhelp still exist!
