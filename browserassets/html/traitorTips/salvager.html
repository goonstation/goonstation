	<p>1. You are an antagonist.  Work with your fellow salvagers to do what you will to the station.</p>

	<p>2. Use your salvage reclaimer to disassemble walls and doors.</p>

	<p>3. Use your omnitool and deconstructor to convert equipment to frames for easy transportation.</p>

	<p>4. Sell your spoils to the M4GP13 Salvage and Barter System for additional gear.  Check with the system to see if there are any special requests.</p>

	<p>6. The Salvager Pods are specially equipped to return back to the Magpie when using the "Return to Magpie" function.  Handheld teleporters are also available to return.</p>

	<p>7. Your objectives will always be stored in your notes. To access them, use the <em>Notes</em> verb.</p>
