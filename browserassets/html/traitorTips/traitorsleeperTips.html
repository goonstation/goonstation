	<p>1. You remember your real allegiance. It is time to repay your debts to the Syndicate.</p>

	<p>2. Unfortunately, the Syndicate doesn't have the resources to equip you with an uplink. Good luck!</p>

    <p>3. There might be more sleeper agents among you. Carefully choose who you trust. </p>

    <p>4. Your objectives will always be stored in your notes. To access them, use the <em>Notes</em> verb.</p>
