	<img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/zoldorf.png")}}" class="center" />

	<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You are not an antagonist! As Zoldorf, your goal is to relay information between the dead and the living.</b>

	<p><b>PASSIVE EFFECTS:</b><br>- You can hear all speech and radio chat<br>- You may click-drag items within one tile of your booth<br>- Click-dragging a fortune to your booth will burn it.</p>

	<p><b>ABILITIES:</b><br>Tell Fortune: This allows you to mad-lib existing words in Zoldorf's vocabulary into a few pre-generated fortune formats. The number of lines scales from 1 to 3 depending on the number of souls collected from crew members. If you ever wish to write less lines, you may cancel the prompt at any time to print a fortune using only the line's you've fully generated up to that point.</p>
	<p>Omen: This ability changes the color of your crystal ball. This is useful for answering direct questions from the crew.</p>
	<p>Medium: Activating your ghost light will allow you to hear dead-chat for 30 seconds with a much longer cooldown. It's best advised to be used when you know people will be talking.</p>
	<p>Brand: Branding one of your fortunes will pass that brand onto the next person to read it, allowing you to observer them using Astral Projection.</p>
	<p>Astral Projection: Observe any branded player. Souldorfs are automatically branded</p>
	<p>Notes: Leave a note for your successors!</p>
	<p>Manifest: This abilitiy manifests your spirit into a silent and ominous form for a short time, allowing you to move around the station freely for that period of time.</p>
	<p>Seance: Your ultimate ability, after a short charging time, all ghosts and souldorfs on your screen will be manifested! Ghosty Party!</p>
	<p>Soul Jar: Visual display of partial souls stored in your booth. Once the jar spills over, you add one soul to your usable pool.</p>

	<p><b>SUCCESSION:</b><br>As you have usurped the previous Zoldorf, you are not immune to being usurped yourself. Other players may hand you the same contract to take over as a new Zoldorf! Doing so will give you a Yes/No prompt. If you say no, you'll have three more minutes of Zoldorfing before you are automatially tossed into the aether.</p>

	<p>After being usurped you will become a free-floating soul orb (Souldorf) which brings you closer to the dead, but with abilities of your own.</p>
