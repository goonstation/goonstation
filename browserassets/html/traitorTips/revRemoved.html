  <p>1. You remembered your real allegiance and devotion to Nanotrasen! Protect the heads of staff and assist loyal crew members in putting down the revolution.</p>

  <p>2. <em>Don't help the revolutionary cause or any of its members!</em> They are now your enemies.</p>

  <p>3. Kill the leaders of the revolution. Converted crew members can be brainwashed by using a counter-revolutionary implant, electropack, electric chair or beating them in the head.</p>
