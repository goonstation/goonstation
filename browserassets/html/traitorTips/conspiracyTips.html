	<img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/traitor-image.png")}}" class="center" />

	<p>You and some of the other crew have entered into forbidden collusion!</p>

	<p>Work with your companions to achieve your aims. You can communicate with them over a secret radio frequency by prefixing what you say with :z. You can review your objective at any time with the <em>Notes</em> verb.</p>

	<p>Gather your team at the initial meeting point. If you want to work on an alternative plot to the assigned objective, go for it!</p>

	<p>Remember, the conspiracy should be fun for everyone! Don't take players out of the round or make their lives miserable just because you can. Make sure to RP and create an engaging story.</p>
