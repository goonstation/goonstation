	<p>1. Work together with your gangster buddies to rack up as many points as you can!<br>
		  You can get points by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tagging the station with your gang's spray can.<br>
		</li>
		<li>Stuffing illicit drugs (like meth and cannabis), guns, and cash into your locker.<br>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>2. Use :g to communicate with your gang! Occassionally you'll hear an announcement over this channel about priority areas - make sure to tag them when you can.</p>

 	<p>3. <em>Don't attack fellow gang members and listen to your leader!</em> You can identify them by the G icon. Blue is your leader, red are your fellow henchmen.</p>

 	<p>4. <em>Defend your locker!</em> It's where you get your gang outfit, spraycan, and special gang-tuned headset! If another gang breaks it, you'll have to start all over.</p>

 	<p>5. Remember, you're free to harm anyone who isn't in your gang, but they can do the same to you, so don't pick fights willy-nilly!</p>
