	<p>1. <em>Your goal</em> is to absorb the DNA of a certain amount of crew members. Use the <em>Notes</em> verb to view the exact amount.</p>

	<p>
		2. Changeling aliens have a number of <em>powers</em> to take down their victims and protect themselves.<br>
		Using some of the powers requires you to expend some <em>DNA points</em>.<br>
		To acquire more, you will have to absorb new victims.
        Any living victim that you absorb will be forced into your <em>hivemind</em>.
		<span class="small indent">
			<em>Absorb DNA</em>, to steal the DNA of your victims. They must be grabbed firmly.<br>
			<em>Toxic Spit</em>, a homing projectile that instantly melts the victim's headgear.<br>
			<em>Hallucinogenic Sting</em>, a stealthy sting that makes people trip.<br>
			On the non-RP servers, <em>Neurotoxic Sting</em>, stealthily KOs your victims in about 30 seconds. Also causes severe brain damage.<br>
			On the RP servers, <em>Capulettium Sting</em>, which doesn't cause brain damage, but will make your victim appear dead while they're unconscious.<br>
			<em>DNA Sting</em>, forces somebody to assume the appearance and name of one of your victims.<br>
			<em>Lesser Form</em>, instantly transforms you into a monkey. Only some abilities are available while in this form. Use the command again to revert to a human body.<br>
			<em>Regenerative Stasis</em>, you will appear dead, and slowly return to full health. You won't be able to move while in stasis.<br>
			<em>Speed Regenerate</em>, heals you on the move and regrows limbs. Very obvious, will expose your alien nature to anyone nearby.<br>
			<em>Transform</em>, lets you transform into one of the identities you have absorbed.<br>
			<em>Mimic Voice</em>, to speak in the voice of other crew members.<br>
            <em>Speak to Hivemind</em>, to telepathically speak with those that you have collected into your hivemind.<br>
            <em>Handspider</em>, to transfer a consciousness from your hivemind into a weak scouting critter.<br>
            <em>Eyespider</em>, to transfer a consciousness from your hivemind into a weaker critter able to see everything.<br>
            <em>Morph Arm</em>, to temporarily replace one of your human arms with a stronger form.<br>
			<em>Horror Form</em>, you turn into a shambling abomination with a special set of abilities. See the <A HREF='http://wiki.ss13.co/Changeling#Shambling_Abomination'>the wiki</A>.<br>
		</span>
		Changelings <em>don't need to breathe</em>, so they can enter space without a spacesuit or internals.

		3. <em>To absorb a human's DNA:</em><br> <img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/changeling-absorb-HUD.png")}}" class="right" />
		<span class="small indent">
			1. Set your intent to GRAB.<br>
			2. Click on your victim until you hold them in a grab.<br>
			3. Click on the grab button until it reads <B>KILL</B>. <em>Headgear will stop you, so make sure your victim has none.</em><br>
			4. Now you can use the Absorb DNA command.
		</span>
	</p>

	<p class="small">If you are interrupted while absorbing a body, the process can be restarted once you return to safety.</p>
