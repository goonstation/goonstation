	<h1 class="center">You are a brainslug inside a human body!</h1>

	<p>1. <em>Your goal</em> is to steal organs from other humans to improve your abilities and evolve.</p>

	<p>
		2. The body you are inhabiting only has a limited amount of stability before it starts to break down.<br>
		Using some of the powers requires you to expend some stability.<br>
		To acquire more, you will have to harvest organs or to swap bodies.
		<span class="small indent">
			<em>Harvest</em>, to harvest a few organs from your victim. This ability stuns after awhile using it and unlocks new abilities and progress towards your final form<br>
			<em>Exit host</em>, to leave your current body and look for a different one. You are very vulnerable when outside a body!<br>
			<em>Spit slime</em>, a projectile spray that blinds your targets and slows them.<br>
			<em>Adhesive spit</em>, covers an item or mob in space glue, either rendering it sticky or slowing it down for awhile.<br>
			<em>Neural detection</em>, allows you to see through walls at the cost of your ability to run.<br>
			When inside a human you have access to the following abilities:<br>
			<em>Restraining spit</em>, instantly restrains a target to prevent them from moving. The target can still be grabbed and moved around. They may hit the slime to free themselves faster.<br>
			You may unlock the following abilities after enough organ harvests:<br>
			<em>Acidic spit</em>, throws a projectile that sprays acid on a few tiles, making them damaging to cross and stand on.<br>
			<em>Summon brood</em>, lets you summon broodlings who will fight for you if your points are low. Consumes all your remaining stability. Summons more broodlings if you had more stability.<br>
			<em>Slinging spit</em>, throws a projectile that anchors itself to the ground and doesn't allow anyone near the point of impact to move away from it while it is alive.<br>
			<em>Pupate</em>, consumes the human body you are in to evolve into your final form.<br>
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		3. When you are outside a body.<br>
		You are a very weak slug with the ability to walk in space and to infect specific targets.
		<span class="small indent">
			<em>Slither</em>, lets you ooze slippery slime from your body to trip pursuers.<br>
			<em>Infest host</em>, to possess an alive small animal or dead human..<br>
			<em>Exit host</em>, to exit the body you may be in.<br>
			<em>Assume control</em>, revives the body you are inside of and gives you control of it.<br>
		</span>
	</p>
		
	<p>
		4. In your adult form.<br>
		You are a strong slug with a powerful mouth able to grab people tightly or bite them for serious damage.
		<span class="small indent">
			<em>Burrow</em>, lets you enter/exit the disposal system if you are in a disposal chute. Or lets you punch through the underground disposal chutes if there are any.<br>
			<em>Molt</em>, cancels all stuns and lets you reflect projectiles shot at you for a short while.<br>
			<em>Neural detection</em>, allows you to see through walls at the cost of your ability to run.<br>
			<em>Acidic sweat</em>, leaves a trail of acidic slime as you run around, burning people who walk or stay in it.<br>
			<em>Inject brood</em>, injects your young into a dead body, exploding out after a short while and attacking passerbys.<br>
			<em>Adhesive spit</em>, covers an item or mob in space glue, either rendering it sticky or slowing it down for awhile.<br>
			<em>Restraining spit</em>, instantly restrains a target to prevent them from moving. The target can still be grabbed and moved around. They may hit the slime to free themselves faster.<br>
			<em>Devour</em>, feasts on a random organ of a target, or on a limb depending on the zone currently aimed at.<br>
