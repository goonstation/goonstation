<h2>How to Play (The Basics)</h2>
<p>1. Work together with your team to fight the enemy, capture strategic locations, and destroy the enemy ship!</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams <b>gain/lose points</b> with kills and by destroying the "Critical Systems" on their base ships and captuing Control Points. Each team starts with 100 points. If any team hits either 200 points or 0 points, the round will end. If you lose all four of your Critical Systems, your team instantly loses. Alternatively it will end after about 90 minutes...</li>
<li><b>Mine</b> the asteroid field! Each team starts with some <b>auto pod fabricators</b> that can make small dinghy pods for free. But you'll need to explore the map or use the mining magnet get materials to make better pods!</li>
<li>At <b>~15 minutes</b> in, an <b>Ion Storm</b> hits and: (A) lowers the shields on each teams' critical systems, and (B) lets teams capture the three control points on Fortuna, UVB-67, and the NSV Reliant.</li>
<li>Holding a <b>control point</b> activates the Warp Beacons so that your team can use pods to warp to it. If a point is held for a consecutive 5, 10, and >15 minutes <b>rewards you with crates of items</b> at the control point computer and <b>subtracts some points from the enemy team</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <b>Follow orders from your commander!</b> Your commander should be easily recognizable by their special equipment, and even more easily recogniable by their star antag icon at the top-right of their sprite! Commanders are worth more points to kill, but they are also able to capture control points at twice the speed!</p>

	<p>3. <b>Death isn't the end!</b> Both teams have extra heavy duty cloning pods that quickly clone dead players back into fresh bodies and fits them with standard equipment. <b>If you want to die for good and spectate</b>, you'll have to set DNR. Use the set-dnr command before you die and you'll be removed from your team and die so you can spectate!</p>

	<p>4. Use the <b>private channel(:g)</b> to communicate with your team! Use the public channel(;) to talk with everyone.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
<p>A couple unassorted tips to help you out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Lock your pods!</b> There's a new pod lock that works based on ID type, Syndicate or NT. Use them!</li>
		<li>The NanoTrasen Base Ship is called the <b>NSV Pytheas</b>. The Syndicate Base Ship is called the <b>Lodbrok</b>.</li>
		<li>Use the <b>scanners on any pod</b> to locate warp beacons of useful locations like both base ships and all control points.(if your team has captured a control point, you will see that beacon name on your list of warp targets)</li>
		<li>There are some new items (deployable barricades, medicated bandages, gun power cells, etc) that can be made from pod manufacturers or wall dispensers.</li>
		<li>Commanders have their star antag overlay visible to all players. So you always know who is your commander and the enemy commander.</li>
		<li>You can't <b>capture control points or destroy enemy critical systems until 15 minutes</b> in when the Ion Storm hits, so it's more profitable to mine and explore the asteroid field for the first few minutes.</li>
		<li>Each Base Ship has a <b>map of the asteroid field</b> on a wall near their pod manufacturing area.</li>
		<li>Your <b>PDA has a GPS program</b> so if you get lost in space without a pod. You can tell your friends to come pick you up.</li>
		<li>Pod Fabricators can build almost any type of pod weapon, provided you have the right materials for it.</li>
		<li>There's a derelict station on the southwest side of the map with a mineral magnet that can be set up to get more minerals.</li>
		<li>Both Base Ships have a <b>medical chem dispenser</b> that can fill beakes with a bunch of pre-programmed medical chems, Fortuna has one with a wider selection.</li>
		<li>If you capture a control point from an enemy team that has already earned a crate tier II or above, then you'll get a tier I crate immediately.</li>
