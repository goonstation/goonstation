	<h1 class="center">You are a SAFL player!</h1>

	<p><strong>The year is 2053 and it's time for some Space American Football League-style football!</strong></p>

	<p>You have 15 minutes to score more points than the other team.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Carrying the ball into the endzone like a winner gives you six big ol' points.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Get dat fukken ball!</strong> The current ball carrier has a big number over their head.</li>
			<li><strong>Don't have the ball?</strong> Use your charge (top left) to steamroll the idiot who has the ball!</li>
			<li>You can throw the ball to your teammates! Remember: There's no I in team.</li>
			<li>If you're a coward, you can also throw the ball into the endzone to score a single, sad point.</li>
			<li><strong>Dead?</strong> Every 15 seconds, a new wave of players will respawn.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		In the SAFL, there are no penalties, no out-of-bounds, no time-outs, and no rules*. Get out there and win!
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 70%;">
		* No <em>football</em> rules. You still have to follow the server rules.
