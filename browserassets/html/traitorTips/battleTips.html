	<p>1. <em>Your goal</em> is to defeat all other battlers and be the last one standing!<br>
	<p>2. If it is the start of the round you are on the <em>BATTLE SHUTTLE</em>! Jump out of the <em>BATTLE SHUTTLE</em> to land somewhere on the station!</p>
	<p>3. Useful things have been placed around the station. Rummage around in lockers and chests to see what you can find!</p>
	<p>4. Deadly <em>Battle Storms</em> occasionally ravage the station. Get to the listed areas or perish in the fire!</p>
	<p>5. Supply drops regularly occur in random areas. Find the airdropped lootcrates for random items with special stats to help you win.</p>
	<p>6. Stay on the station or take constant battle damage for cowardice!</p>
