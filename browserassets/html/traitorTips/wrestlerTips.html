	<h1 class="center">You are a wrestler!</h1>

	<p>1. You have access to a couple of wrestling moves:
	<span class="small"><br><br>
		<em>Kick</em> people away from you. [1]<br>
		<em>Strike</em> to briefly stuns a nearby person. [1]<br>
		<em>Drop</em> onto a prone opponent. [1]<br>
		<em>Throw</em> somebody across the room.<br>
		<em>Slam</em> somebody into the floor.<br>
		Use the <em>*flip emote</em> to jump onto tables.<br>
		Grab people firmly and <em>*flip</em> to deal extra damage.<br>
		Climb onto chairs and <em>*flip</em> to jump into people.<br>
		<em>Punching</em> somebody also has a chance of sending them flying.<br>
	</span>
	</p>

	<p>2. All moves <em>marked with [1]</em> require manual target selection if there's more than one person adjacent to you.<p>

	<p>3. Also keep in mind that <em>Slam and Throw</em> actions require a tight grip on someone, and that <em>Drop</em> can only target prone opponents.<br>

	<p>4. You can reduce the cooldown of the moves with coffee, sugar, meth or other stimulants in your bloodstream.</p>
