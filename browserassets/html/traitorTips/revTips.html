    <h1 class="center">You are a leader of the revolution!</h1>
    <p>1. Your goal is to kill all heads of staff on the station. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Captain, Head of Personnel, Head of Security,<br>
      </li>
      <li>Chief Engineer, Research Director, Medical Director<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. Avoid civilian casualties and convert other players to revolutionaries instead by using any flash on them. Heads of staff, synthetics and security personnel cannot be converted.</p>
    <p>A revolutionary uplink has been disguised as your PDA (or your headset if you lack a PDA). Check the "notes" verb in the Commands tab to see the uplink code then change your PDA's ring message to it.</p>
    <p>3. You cannot abandon your mission! Do not, under any circumstances, leave the station Z-Level. If you do, you will be treated as dead!</p>
