	<p>2. <em>Beware!</em> Werewolves can't wear jumpsuits, exosuits or shoes. Furthermore, the wolf-like form is completely useless for stealth.</p>

	<p>3. Use the <em>DISARM</em> intent on somebody for a guaranteed (but brief) knockdown, or slash at them with the <em>HARM</em> intent to wear down their health and capacity to fight back.

	<p>4. Once you've incapacitated the victim, use the <em>Maul Victim</em> ability to feast on them. This will also heal a considerable amount of brute and burn damage in case you're injured.

	<p>5. Certain leftover organs can be <em>consumed</em> to restore a minor amount of health.
