    <h1 class="center">You have been revived as a Zombie!</h1>
    <p>You are now a zombie, this means that you should kill the living, and not harm your fellow zombie brethren.</p>
	<p>Kill and infect people with your "Zombify" ability. It will add more friends to your hoard of undead! </p>
	<p>Simply attacking humans, normally will infect them if you land enough hits in a short enough time. Using the ability on the living infects them immediately, but it still takes a while for the infection to completely turn them into a zombie.</p>
	<p> Scratching/biting/"Zombifying" a dead human will instantly convert them to a new friend!</p>
	<p>You may be a mutated zombie and have unique powers! Check your DNA powers bar to see if you have any active genes!</p>
