  <h1 class="center">You are now a revolutionary!</h1>
  <p>1. Work together with your comrades to kill the heads of staff. They are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Captain, Head of Personnel, Head of Security,<br>
    </li>
    <li>Chief Engineer, Research Director, Medical Director<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>2. <em>Don't attack fellow freedom fighters!</em> You can identify them by the R icon. Blue is a leader, red is a converted crew member. <em>Adminhelp</em> if one of the revolutionaries violates this.</p>

  <p>3. Avoid civilian casualties; the revolution requires manpower. Get your leaders to convert them instead.</p>
