	<h1 class="center">You are a hunter!</h1>

	<p>1. Use the <em>Order Hunting Gear</em> ability in a secure place to retrieve your items. Your objectives will always be stored in your notes. To access them, use the <em>Notes</em> verb.</p>

	<p>2. You are a hunter of dangerous game. Use your gear to hunt down the crew:
	<span class="small"><br><br>
		<em>Mask</em> with built-in thermal vision and voice changer.<br>
		<em>Cloaking Device</em>, makes you invisible.<br>
		<em>Laser Rifle</em>, self-charging.<br>
		<em>Spear</em>, can be thrown for an instant stun.<br>
		<em>Rubberized Shoes</em>, preventing you from slipping on blood and gibs.<br>
	</span>
	</p>

	<p>3. Take skulls with the <em>Take Trophy</em> command to impress your hunter comrades! The ability works on corpses as well as severed heads. Store the trophies in your belt, backpack or backpack box.</p>

	<p>4. Skulls of worthy foes are more valuable; examine them to see exactly how much they're worth. You can view your overall progress with the <em>Check Trophy Value</em> command.</p>
