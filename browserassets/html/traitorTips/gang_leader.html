	<p>1. Work together with your subordinates to rack up as many points as you can!<br>
		  You can get points by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Claiming popular parts of the station with spray cans. Gang tags that see people generate points!<br>
		</li>
		<li>Collecting weapon drops and crates. Watch the radio to find out about tip-offs!<br>
		</li>
		<li>Cram large quantities of cash into your locker to launder it into points!<br>
		</li>
		<li>Finally, cram guns, drugs & weed into your locker for even more points to spend!<br>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>2. <b>Be prepared!</b> You have access to the leader-specific 'Street Cred':</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Street cred is earned the same as points, and spendable in the top right of the Locker.</li>
		<li>Revival syringes let you bring a dead gang member back to life; or let gang members bring you back to life!</li>
		<li>If there's no corpse to revive, you can buy a new gang member, who'll spawn at your locker in their place!</li>
	</ul>

	<p>3. Use the prefix :z to speak on your gang's radio frequency! Pay attention to it:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Every so often, your gang will PDA message the location of a bag of weapons to a civilian! <br>
		</li>
		<li>You will only know which civilian recieved the message. <em>Ask them for it! Bribe them! Steal their PDA!</em><br>
		</li>
		<li>Weapon crates will occasionally spawn, too. Drag these to your locker and open them for guns & ammo! <br>
		</li>
	</ul>

 	<p>4. Wear your gang outfit proudly, and don't hide it under suits! Gang members in enemy territory will get a debuff if they aren't wearing their gangs' getup.</p>

 	<p>5. Remember, you're free to harm anyone who isn't in your gang, but they can do the same to you, so don't pick fights willy-nilly!</p>
