  <h1 class="center">You have been polymorphed!</h1>

  <p>A wizard has polymorphed you into another form! The spell will wear off in <b>eight minutes</b> and return your previous body.</p>

	<p>You are reduced in your capacity but you can still fight the wizard! However, <b>you should not randomly attack the crew</b> unless you were somehow already an antagonist. If the crew thinks you're a regular critter, talk to them first!</p>
