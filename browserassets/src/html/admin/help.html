    <a name="overview"></a>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Space Station 13 was written for BYOND. Like many BYOND games, it is two
      dimensional with a top down view and runs terribly. It uses tile-based
      movement. Space Station 13 (or SS13 for short) starts you on a space
      station orbiting a very peculiar gaseous planet in a binary star system.
      Each round type is centred around a specific type of disaster, ranging
      from a meteor shower to a traitor within the crew. The game is constantly
      being developed, so new modes are added all the time!
    </p>

    <a name="objectives"></a>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      The primary objective in most modes of Space Station 13 is survival. You
      must try to stay alive long enough to escape on the evacuation shuttle.
      This doesn't mean you should immediately rush to the escape dock and wall
      yourself in; half the fun is in trying to keep the station running for as
      long as possible. Exactly how you do this is up to you and your assigned
      job.
    </p>

    <a name="getting_started"></a>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      The interface for Space Station 13 is largely click driven. To use
      something, you will almost always click or double click.
    </p>

    <a name="movement"></a>
    <h2>Movement</h2>
    <p>
      Movement on SS13 goes in the 4 cardinal directions (use END for the only
      diagonal allowed). If you move into a dense movable object you will try to
      push it. You can right click on an object and select 'pull' to drag it
      behind you. To stop pulling click the PULL button on your interface, it
      will lose the highlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      To drop to the ground hit the STAND button on the UI. You will lie on the
      ground and drop items in your hands. To return upright hit the REST
      button.
    </p>

    <a name="equipping"></a>
    <h2>Equipping</h2>
    <p>
      Items are equipped by placing in either hand or in the proper inventory
      slot. Your backpack gives you more space, and you can carry various
      toolboxes or use toolbelts to expand your storage. The active hand is
      highlighted in brown in the UI, you can switch hands by clicking on the
      inactive UI hand-slot or using the middle mouse-button.
    </p>

    <a name="talking"></a>
    <h2>Talking</h2>
    <p>
      Type say in the command line and hit enter to bring up a window where to
      type wha you want to say. You can also write sentences in the command line
      by typing say, then space. These will be heard by all those in hearing
      range. To speak in your headset use a semicolon after say "say ; phrase".
      Some headset have a department channel, you can speak there using "say :h
      phrase".
    </p>
    <p>
      Say is also used for emotes, they are performed by preceding their name
      with an asterisk "say *emote". Two lists of available emotes are displayed
      with "say *listbasic" and "say *listtarget". Custom emotes can be written
      by using "say *custom", and typing the actions you want to display in the
      pop-up window.
    </p>

    <a name="takegive"></a>
    <h2>Taking Items / Giving Items</h2>
    <p>
      You can take items from people by dragging from their character sprite
      onto yours. A screen will pop up. From this screen you can select an
      object to remove from them. If you select a 'Nothing' slot then you will
      attempt to equip that slot with the object you are holding.
    </p>

    <a name="hotkeys"></a>
    <h2>Hotkeys</h2>
    <p>
      <li><b>Pull:</b> Ctrl-Left click</li>
      <li><b>Examine:</b> Alt-Left click</li>
      <li><b>Switch Hands:</b> Page-Up or Middle click</li>
      <li><b>Use item in the active hand:</b> Page Down</li>
    </p>

    <a name="death"></a>
    <h2>Death</h2>
    <p>
      If you are dead then you can use the ghost verb to separate from your dead
      body and move around. Or the observe verb to look through the eyes of
      another character.
    </p>

    <a name="modes"></a>
    <h2>Modes</h2>

    <a name="mode_traitor"></a>
    <h3>Traitor</h3>
    <p>
      Several traitors are aboard the space station. Each traitor is assigned
      random objectives, they will steal, murder and sabotage. The objective of
      everyone else is to stop the traitor and survive!
    </p>

    <a name="mode_changeling"></a>
    <h3>Changeling</h3>
    <p>
      Shapeshifting aliens are mixed with the crew. They will try to kill and
      absorb crewmembers and finally escape on the shuttle. Changelings can
      assume the identity of anyone they absorbed, don't let them get too close.
    </p>

    <a name="mode_wizard"></a>
    <h3>Wizard</h3>
    <p>
      The Space Federation of Wizards has scores to settle. Magical humans have
      been dispatched to the station to sow the panic amongst the crew. As a
      crewmember, you must defeat the wizards, or cower in fear until the
      evacuation shuttle comes.
    </p>

    <a name="mode_mixed"></a>
    <h3>Mixed</h3>
    <p>
      All of the above enemies at once. And vampires! Undead lords thirsty for
      blood. Vampires increase in strength and powers the more blood the gather.
      Will you be up to the challenge?
    </p>

    <a name="mode_spy"></a>
    <h3>Spy</h3>
    <p>
      Several spies have mixed with the crew. Each carries four special mindhack
      implants to recruite their posse. The main objective of each spy is to
      identify and kill all of the other, and be the only spy to make it alive
      on the shuttle. Not a spy? Try and survive the crossfire.
    </p>

    <a name="mode_nuclear"></a>
    <h3>Nuclear Emergency</h3>
    <p>
      A crack team of Syndicate operatives have assaulted the station in order
      to gather a nuclear authentication disk. If found, the team will detonate
      a NUCLEAR BOMB and the station will be destroyed! The team must detain or
      kill the Syndicate force; or escape with the nuclear authentication disk
      in their possession.
    </p>

      <b>PROTIP: IF YOU KILL A MEMBER OF THE SYNDICATE STEAL HIS STUFF.</b>
