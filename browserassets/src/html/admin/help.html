        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Space Station 13 was written for BYOND. Like many BYOND games, it is two
            dimensional with a top down view and runs terribly. It uses tile-based
            movement. Space Station 13 (or SS13 for short) starts you on a space station
            orbiting a very peculiar gaseous planet in a binary star system. Each round
            type is centred around a specific type of disaster, ranging from a meteor
            shower to a traitor within the crew. The game is constantly being developed,
            so new modes are added all the time!
        </p>

        <a name="objectives"></a>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            The primary objective in most modes of Space Station 13 is survival. You must
            try to stay alive long enough to escape on the evacuation shuttle. This
            doesn't mean you should immediately rush to the escape dock and wall yourself
            in; half the fun is in trying to keep the station running for as long as
            possible. Exactly how you do this is up to you and your assigned job.
        </p>

        <a name="getting_started"></a>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            The interface for Space Station 13 is largely click driven. To use something,
            you will almost always click or double click.
        </p>

        <a name="movement"></a>
        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <p>
            Movement on SS13 goes in the 4 cardinal directions (use END for the only diagonal allowed). If you move into a dense movable object you will try to push it. You can right click on an object and select 'pull' to drag it behind you. To stop pulling click the PULL button on your interface, it will lose the highlight.
	<p>
	    To drop to the ground hit the STAND button on the UI. You will lie on the ground and drop items in your hands. To return upright hit the REST button.
	</p>
        </p>

        <a name="equipping"></a>
        <h2>Equipping</h2>
        <p>
            Items are equipped by placing in either hand or in the proper inventory slot. Your backpack gives you more space, and you can carry various toolboxes or use toolbelts to expand your storage.
            The active hand is highlighted in brown in the UI, you can switch hands by clicking on the inactive UI hand-slot or using the middle mouse-button.
        </p>

        <a name="talking"></a>
        <h2>Talking</h2>
        <p>
            Type say in the command line and hit enter to bring up a window where to type wha you want to say.
You can also write sentences in the command line by typing say, then space. These will be heard by all those in hearing range.
To speak in your headset use a semicolon after say "say ; phrase". Some headset have a department channel, you can speak there using "say :h phrase".
	</p>
	<p>
Say is also used for emotes, they are performed by preceding their name with an asterisk "say *emote". Two lists of available emotes are displayed with "say *listbasic" and "say *listtarget".
Custom emotes can be written by using "say *custom", and typing the actions you want to display in the pop-up window.
        </p>

        <a name="takegive"></a>
        <h2>Taking Items / Giving Items</h2>
        <p>
            You can take items from people by dragging from their character sprite onto yours. A screen
            will pop up. From this screen you can select an object to remove from them.
            If you select a 'Nothing' slot then you will attempt to equip that slot with
            the object you are holding.
        </p>

        <a name="hotkeys"></a>
        <h2>Hotkeys</h2>

        <a name="death"></a>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>

        <h3>Changeling</h3>

        </p>

        <a name="mode_wizard"></a>
        <h3>Wizard</h3>
        <p>
            The Space Federation of Wizards has scores to settle. Magical humans have been dispatched to the station to sow the panic amongst the crew. As a crewmember, you must defeat the wizards, or cower in fear until the evacuation shuttle comes.
        </p>

        <a name="mode_mixed"></a>
        <h3>Mixed</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>Spy</h3>
        <p>
            Several spies have mixed with the crew. Each carries four special mindhack implants to recruite their posse. The main objective of each spy is to identify and kill all of the other, and be the only spy to make it alive on the shuttle.
Not a spy? Try and survive the crossfire.

        <a name="mode_nuclear"></a>
        <h3>Nuclear Emergency</h3>

            gather a nuclear authentication disk. If found, the team will detonate a NUCLEAR
            BOMB and the station will be destroyed! The team must detain or kill the Syndicate force; or 		    escape with the nuclear authentication disk in their possession.
