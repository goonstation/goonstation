    <h1 class="center">Making a Space Pod!</h1>

    <p>
      Be advised that you have to stand adjacent to the south west corner of the
      pod in order to construct it, since it is a 64x64 sprite. Use a bottle of
      champagne on the finished pod to give it a unique name.
    </p>

    <h3>You will need:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A preassembled pod kit</li>
      <li>A set of pod armour</li>
      <li>(Optional: a paint job kit)</li>
      <li>A screwdriver</li>
      <li>A wrench</li>
      <li>A welder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To make:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Deploy the frame kit by clicking on the box.</li>
      <li>
        Wrench the jumble of metal. It should look less like a pile of junk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weld it. It should look like a functional but unsecured frame of a space
        pod.
      </li>
      <li>Use the screwdriver.</li>
      <li>Put armor on the pod frame.</li>
      <li>Wrench the now armored frame</li>
      <li>Use the welder.</li>
      <li>Use a screwdriver to close up the final parts</li>
      <li>Optionally, use the paint job kit on the finished pod.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="center">Making a Mini Putt!</h1>
    <p>
      The main preassembled kit is the only thing different, but the
      construction plan is otherwise the same. And as with space pods, you can
      rename the finished craft with a champagne bottle.
