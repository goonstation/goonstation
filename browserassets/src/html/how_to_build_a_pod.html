<p>Be advised that you have to stand adjacent to the south west corner of the pod in order to construct it, since it is a 64x64 sprite. Use a bottle of champagne on the finished pod to give it a unique name.</p>

<h3>You will need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A preassembled pod kit</li>
<li>A set of pod armour</li>
<li>(Optional: a paint job kit)</li>
<li>A screwdriver</li>
<li>A wrench</li>
<li>A welder</li>
</ul>
<h3>To make:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Deploy the frame kit by clicking on the box.</li>
<li>Wrench the jumble of metal. It should look less like a pile of junk.</li>
<li>Weld it. It should look like a functional but unsecured frame of a space pod.</li>
<li>Use the screwdriver.</li>
<li>Put armor on the pod frame.</li>
<li>Wrench the now armored frame</li>
<li>Use the welder.</li>
<li>Use a screwdriver to close up the final parts</li>
<li>Optionally, use the paint job kit on the finished pod.</li>
</ol>

<h1 class="center">Making a Mini Putt!</h1>
<p>The main preassembled kit is the only thing different, but the construction plan is otherwise the same. And as with space pods, you can rename the finished craft with a champagne bottle.</p>

<h3>You will need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A preassembled mini-putt kit</li>
<li>A set of pod armour</li>
<li>(Optional: a paint job kit)</li>
<li>A screwdriver</li>
<li>A wrench</li>
<li>A welder</li>
</ul>

<h3>To make:</h3>
