# This is the file you modify if you want to make yourself an admin.
# The available ranks can be found in /proc/rank_to_level().
# Most of the time, you'll want to make yourself a Host.
# To do so, type your BYOND key with no spaces, capitals or other punctuation (including underscores!),
# a dash with spaces on both side, then the rank you want.
# For example, the key "ZeWaka" would be given Host rank like this: zewaka - Host

# This is a sample file; make a copy as "admins.txt" and edit that instead.

opponentbacon - Host
