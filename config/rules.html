<h1>Goon Station 13</h1>


<h2>GOONSERVER RULES</h2>
The rules displayed here are a shorter version of the rules page on the goonstation wiki.<br>
It is strongly recommended that you read the wiki's rules page if you want to play without risk of a ban.<br>
You can find the full Rules page at the following URL:<br>
<b>http://wiki.ss13.co/Rules</b><br><br>
<font color="red"><b>THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. RULES CAN CHANGE ROUND BY ROUND. IF IN DOUBT, ADMINHELP BEFORE YOU ACT.</b></font><br>
<ol>
<li>Have fun! Try to have fun with other players too, and try not to be too much of a jerk if you're not a traitor. </li>
<li>You are encouraged to roleplay however you wish, but DO NOT use excessive bigotry, racism or use any sexual content at all. This includes anything ironic or "it's fine because I say it in real life."</li>
<li>This game relies on trickery and sneakiness, so don't cheat by using multiple accounts or by coordinating with other players through out-of-game communication means. </li>
<li>Do not use the OOC (Out of character) channel to spoil IC (In character) events, like the identity of a traitor/changeling. Likewise, do not treat IC chat like OOC (saying things like ((this round sucks)) over radio, etc)</li>
<li>If an admin asks you to explain your actions or asks you to stop doing something, you probably ought to do so. If you think someone is breaking the rules or ruining the game for everyone else somehow, use the ADMINHELP verb to give us a shout. If you just want tips on how to play the game, try MENTORHELP. </li>
<li>If you are the AI or a head position and have to log off, PLEASE adminhelp a quick message. You do not need to wait for a response, but it really helps to know as it can seriously hamstring the station if you just disappear or go AFK.</li>
</ol>
The rules list is not the be-all and end-all. Admin discretion will be exercised.<br>
If you have a dispute with the admins or wish to appeal a ban, go to the following URL:<br>

Don't piss off the admins.<br>
