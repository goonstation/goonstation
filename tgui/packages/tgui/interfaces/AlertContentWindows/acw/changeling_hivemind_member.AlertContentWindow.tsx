        This is <em>not</em> the end, you are now a part of the changeling
        hivemind.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a member of the hivemind, you can assist your master in a variety of
        ways:
      </p>
      <span className="small indent">
        <p>
          <em>Talk</em> to them, giving them any information that might further
          their goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Point</em> things out to them, only your master and other hivemind
          members can see your points.
        </p>
        <p className="image-right">
          <em>Be animated</em> as a sentient body part.
          <img
            src={resource('images/antagTips/handspider.png')}
            className="right"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Spit acid</em> by clicking while your master is in horror form.
        </p>
      </span>
      <p>
        You may exit the hivemind and return to ghost form by using the
        &quot;Exit hivemind&quot; command under the commands tab at the top
        right of your screen.
