        1. <em>Your mission</em> is to identify and kill the other spies on the
        station.
        <br />
        You must be the only spy to escape on the shuttle.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. You have 4 implants to <em>mindhack other players</em> in the starter
        kit in your backpack, along with other gear. Use them to carry out your
        purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. <em>Use stealth.</em> Keep your identity as a spy hidden from other
        players and security.
        <br />
        Get help from your mindhacks for the most dangerous tasks.
