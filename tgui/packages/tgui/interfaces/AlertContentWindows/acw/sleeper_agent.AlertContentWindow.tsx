        1. You remember your real allegiance. It is time to repay your debts to
        the Syndicate.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Unfortunately, the Syndicate doesn&apos;t have the resources to equip
        you with an uplink. Good luck!
      </p>

      <p>
        3. There might be more sleeper agents among you. Carefully choose who
        you trust.{' '}

      <p>
        4. Your objectives will always be stored in your notes. To access them,
        use the <em>Notes</em> verb.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. You now have access to the listening post through the usage of a hand
        scanning device near the door.
