        1. <em>Your goal</em> is to absorb the DNA of a certain amount of crew
        members. Use the <em>Notes</em> verb to view the exact amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Changeling aliens have a number of <em>powers</em> to take down their
        victims and protect themselves.
        <br />
        Using some of the powers requires you to expend some <em>DNA points</em>
        .<br />
        To acquire more, you will have to absorb new victims. Any living victim
        that you absorb will be forced into your <em>hivemind</em>.
        <span className="small indent">
          <em>Absorb DNA</em>, to steal the DNA of your victims. They must be
          grabbed firmly.
          <br />
          <em>Toxic Spit</em>, a homing projectile that instantly melts the
          victim&apos;s headgear.
          <br />
          <em>Hallucinogenic Sting</em>, a stealthy sting that makes people
          trip.
          <br />
          On the non-RP servers, <em>Neurotoxic Sting</em>, stealthily KOs your
          victims in about 30 seconds. Also causes severe brain damage.
          <br />
          On the RP servers, <em>Capulettium Sting</em>, which doesn&apos;t
          cause brain damage, but will make your victim appear dead while
          they&apos;re unconscious.
          <br />
          <em>DNA Sting</em>, forces somebody to assume the appearance and name
          of one of your victims.
          <br />
          <em>Lesser Form</em>, instantly transforms you into a monkey. Only
          some abilities are available while in this form. Use the command again
          to revert to a human body.
          <br />
          <em>Regenerative Stasis</em>, you will appear dead, and slowly return
          to full health. You won&apos;t be able to move while in stasis.
          <br />
          <em>Speed Regenerate</em>, heals you on the move and regrows limbs.
          Very obvious, will expose your alien nature to anyone nearby.
          <br />
          <em>Transform</em>, lets you transform into one of the identities you
          have absorbed.
          <br />
          <em>Mimic Voice</em>, to speak in the voice of other crew members.
          <br />
          <em>Speak to Hivemind</em>, to telepathically speak with those that
          you have collected into your hivemind.
          <br />
          <em>Handspider</em>, to transfer a consciousness from your hivemind
          into a weak scouting critter.
          <br />
          <em>Eyespider</em>, to transfer a consciousness from your hivemind
          into a weaker critter able to see everything.
          <br />
          <em>Morph Arm</em>, to temporarily replace one of your human arms with
          a stronger form.
          <br />
          <em>Horror Form</em>, you turn into a shambling abomination with a
          special set of abilities. See the{' '}
