        You are a member of the Kudzu hivemind! Not an antagonist!

      <p>
        1. Your new goal is very straightforward, protect and grow the kudzu so
        that all may enjoy your beauty!
        <br />
        <em>
          Kudzu is non-violent by nature, do not harm humans unless they harm
          you!
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        2. <em>You must stay on kudzu tiles to survive!</em> You have a pool of
        nutrients that are essential to life as a plant-man. Staying on kudzu
        tiles refills it, you rapidly lose them if not connected. When you run
        out, you&apos;ll take high damage and be stunned.
      </p>

      <p>3. You have several organic, plant-based abilities now.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Guide Growth - Mark a tile with non-invasive kudzu flowers to prevent
          more kudzu from growing on that tile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stealth - Secrete some of your nutrients points over time in order to
          blend into the background. Making you pretty hard to see while on top
          of kudzu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heal Other - Target a human or kudzu person to heal them. If they are
          a kudzu person then you also transfer some of your nutrients to them.
        </li>
        <li>Speak Kudzu- Talk to the kudzu hive mind.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        3. <em>Don&apos;t attack fellow kudzu people!</em> Ideally you
        shouldn&apos;t be attacking anyone since kudzu is nonviolent, but there
        are times you must protect yourself. Since other kudzu people are
        technically part of yourself and the kudzu you should not harm them/you.
