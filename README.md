## FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)

#### Q: I'm getting a compilation error like `unable to open +secret\__secret.dme`.

Youâ€™ll need to create a file named `__secret.dme` in the +secret subdirectory. It should be blank and have no contents. Read the [Goonstation Development Guide](https://hackmd.io/@ZeWaka/goondev) for additional details.
