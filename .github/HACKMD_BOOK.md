Goonstation Knowledgebase
===

**If you're reading this and you're not trying to edit the various links someone broke the wiki again. Please ping @ZeWaka on Discord to change it back to "Book Mode".**

If you *are* trying to edit the links, then this is where you need to be.

Everything that's not headings or list items is ignored. Like this text.

To add a new note, type ``\[`` (without the backslash), then enter the title of the new note, then select "Add new team note".

Remember that these are live edits. If you're editing a link, be fast, or copy-paste your changes in. Otherwise, some unlucky dude might load the pages at the wrong time and get a broken nav pane.
