Please address any outstanding review items and ensure your PR is finished. If you are auto-staled anyway, ask developers if your PR will be merged. Once you have done any of the previous actions then you should request a developer remove the stale label on your PR, to reset the stale timer. If you feel no developer will respond in that time, you may wish to close this PR youself, while you seek developer comment, as you will then be able to reopen the PR yourself."
