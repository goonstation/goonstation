(*)Given that very little nuke round development took place since May, it seemed appropriate to finally make some simple but significant adjustments based on user feedback.
(*)Added seven new target areas. Some are more in the crew's favour than others, but they're all temporary and will have to be rebalanced for Cogmap 2 anyway.
(*)Timer now defaults to 8 min, and unscrewing the nuke halves the countdown instead of dropping it to 60 seconds. The good ol' auth disk can be inserted to add (crew member) or shave off (nuke ops) 3 min once, but this is entirely optional.
(*)The Syndicate leader spawns with an old-fashioned auth disk pinpointer. His team may want to use it to infiltrate the station stealthily in preparation for the main strike.
(*)Made the nuke invulnerable to explosions (shame on you, suicide bombers). However, it actually takes damage from melee attacks now, and a couple of people with looted eswords will make short work of it. Unchanged: you can also shoot, laser or EMP the nuke.
(*)Removed some 2011-era code that would magically teleport the nuke back to Z1 under certain circumstances. The pod method of dealing with the nuke should be more reliable as a result.

(*)Due to popular demand, wrestling moves don't use manual aiming anymore in case there's only one target nearby.
(*)Inconsistent behavior is unintuitive to some extent (and was the motivation for that particular change), but it's acceptable if you prefer the status quo.

(*)Enabled what I'm calling "CDN resource mode". This basically stops byond from sending you files necessary for popups and such, and instead links to where they are hosted on an external server (goonhub).
(*)This replaces the resource preloader thing and will eliminate all popup related lag. Aside from that, you shouldn't notice much difference.
(*)However, if you do spot a popup with a broken image or broken styling or whatever, please let me know.

(*)IT'S A WRAITH REBALANCE HOEDOWN, EVERYBODY GET HYPE
(*)After a bunch of testing and discussion I've made a bunch of changes, some major and some minor. If it goes well I might bump up wraith spawn rate.
(*)The Big Change: Absorb Corpse's cooldown starts at 45 seconds and scales exponentially with each use. Much faster early game, much harder to get into scientific notation with your wraith points.
(*)The Big Change 2: Wraiths can only survive one banishment now, instead of two. When banished, Absorb Corpse's scaling and cooldown are reset.
(*)Revenants make a bigger, angrier red message when animated.
(*)Push has apparently had a very long-standing bug where it didnt work right on objects or doors, w h o o p s that's fixed now.
(*)Possess Object's cooldown reduced by 30 seconds.
(*)Salt lines can now be destroyed by careless foot traffic. Walking dramatically reduces the chance to scuff up a salt line, but its still not a great idea to put them in incredibly high traffic areas. Try using walls or redundant layers.
(*)If you notice any added bugs or weirdness dial 1-800-IMC-ODER
(*)These tweaks, as always, are subject to re-tweaking based on further testing and input.

(*)Syndicate and Wizard modes will no longer end instantly if the antagonists die. Instead, once they are all dead late join antagonists may begin to appear. This won't happen if the bad guys are kept alive and locked up somewhere!
(*)You can now chop off people's limbs from the strip menu while holding certain items. This is slower than surgery, but only requires them to be unable to move.

(*)Reworked medical sleepers, which should now be capable of keeping light-crit patients stabilized for a reasonable amount of time (as opposed to being pretty much pointless).

(*)Activators that have successfully activated a power in a human (not monkeys!) can be recycled by putting them back in the genetics terminal.
(*)Doing this yields various rewards, and will decrease research costs and times up to a cap.
(*)One of the new rewards is Chromosomes, which can be used on activated mutations to improve them in various ways.

(u)Marquesas
(*)<b>It's-a me, Marquesas</b> doing more changes which:

(*)Automatic updates (descriptions and icons where applicable) for all ammo boxes. Guns can be examined to check the current ammo type, and also be unloaded at will. The .357 Mag revolver can chamber .38 Spc rounds like in RL.
(*)Spent casings are now a thing. Some guns eject them automatically (shotguns, .22 pistol), others on reload (revolvers, zip gun). And yes, the forensic profile of the gun is taken into account.

(*)Reminder: forensic profiles for guns and projectiles were already a thing.
(*)The fingerprint system should be more robust in general now. Melee attacks, pulling, accessing somebody's inventory etc. all leave prints on the victim.

(*)After the barrage of genetics nerfs it's time to tweak one that was probably too punishing in retrospect.
(*)This wasn't in the changelog before now (I think) but the feature is this: Powers give you genetic instability. The lower it is, the more Terrible Things happen to you.
(*)The change: BAD mutations now give you MORE stability, and low stability doesn't make you mutate like you gargled with the Ooze from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
(*)Yes, this means that if you want to activate a bunch of superpowers at once, you will either deal with the Bad Shit that happens with low stability or you need to layer Bad Shit on yourself with bad mutations. IMO this is way more entertaining than just having an arbitrary "fuck you" limit.
(*)The actual stability increases and decreases for certain genes have been tweaked a bit, and may require further balancing after "playtesting" (watching people run shit into the ground), so please give your input on the forums/to admins/whatever if you've got a bone to pick about the new system.

(*)We also noticed that genetics would ignore corpses in favor of fetching more monkeys from the monkey pen, so now their access to it goes through the surgical bay so the antisocial fuckers are forced to at least acknowledge the rest of the station.
(*)We took away the Port-A-Genes too while we were at it because wow, THAT experiment backfired!
(*)Nearly forgot, we put safety inhibitors in the enzymatic reclaimer so you can't just stuff living people that have mildly annoyed you inside without emagging it first.
(*)As part of the remodeling to encourage geneticists to do their goddamned jobs, surgery and cryo share their space now to give a more natural flow to treating the critically injured.

(*)However, hitting the negative stamina cap (indicated by a full, blinking stamina bar) will still knock you out.
(*)Melee attacks now have a chance to cause critical stamina damage.
(*)Disarm mode now gives you a chance to block attacks.
(*)Not new but important: The chance of knocking someone down with disarm depends on how much stamina they have. (actual disarming is unaffected)

(*)There is now a confirmation for emptying out plant pots with viable plants in them.
(*)Clicking on equipped stacks of metal, glass, and rods with an empty hand will now allow you to specify the number to take from the existing stack, instead of grabbing one at a time.

(*)Sound ranges may be higher or lower than expected, we are tweaking that, too.
