(*)Apologies for switching things up - this is actually a super important change to reduce lag that players experience when they use right-click.

(*)A bunch of debug-overlay stuff. Specifically:
(*)Re-added the teleblocked overlay (now with less lag)

(*)"Remastered" batman.dm to be functional with modern codebase. All the goods are inside a new batman mob type. Slightly reworked the mechanics to be less gib-buttons and more stun-oriented. Viable for admin gimmicks, though still very janky, clunky and not yet using the new ability system, similarly to macho man, sorry!!!

(*)Player Panel overhauled. It's rearranged, totally different, and sucks.
(*)"Notes" and "Logs" are in the top right, since they're the most useful.

(*)Quick info on health and location are now shown.
