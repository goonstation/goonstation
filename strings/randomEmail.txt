Analysis of the marking showed them to be blood. @,The team continued through the station until they reached the control station for the solar arrays. @,Here, they found one of the crewmen manning the controls. @,Naked except for a crude loincloth made from the tattered remains of a jumpsuit, he gestured at the team to follow him. @,They took him to the supply bay, where RSS3's captain sat on a chair carved from a bizarre alien artifact. @,He explained that it had given him the strength to fight off the syndicate, and that he was no longer the captain,@,but the High Priest, and all the crew followed him by right of blood. @,@,After much negotiation with High Priest Andrews of RSS3, it has been agreed that, @,If Andrews agrees to continue operating RSS3 in its previous capacity as a depot for automated shuttles, @,then NanoTrasen will provide him with food, water, and live goats to sacrifice to the artifact. @,His request for 1 living syndicate prisoner per year is currently pending approval.@,@,I'm sure you understand why it's best if everyone else thinks nothing has changed.@,@,Takashi Nakamoto@,Regional Morale Officer@,Regional Command, Section 13
