	No.
	Monkeys was here '12!!!

	Get out.
	Gentlemen, our goal at this point seems clear enough: this version has to become just as good if not better as the goon version already is. That is, it should contain every single feature their version has, but better.
	I have decided to take on a more aggressive attitude: if I don't see a sufficient amount of players on the server *and* active, I'm shutting it down until enough requests are made to put it back up. I don't give a rats ass how many different versions there are. You pick a side: me, or them. If you choose me, you better be here and not on any other servers. If you choose them, enjoy the horrible administration that ensues because of it. Thank you for wasting my time yet again.
	Here's the deal: if you fear me, continue your ranting. If you don't, just bugger off and continue with your lives instead of wasting time here.
	Hey guys its the your boi master troller and to day i'm here to talk about the admins because i'm now there slave so holy shit and they TOLD ME to make an admin person song so here it goes.

	I'm just a lovable ol' furry with an internet addiction
	AHem, i'm back. Not like you guys care anyways. but my parents let me have extra time, sooo...
	The honest bit in that is that I did not request to be given life, as such, I cannot be held responsible for my actions since I don't know what they're going to be.

	mport was a cool guy who was misunderstood
	readster i want to know why youre such a corrupt admin
	the most potent lives are the ones we tell ourselves
	The remake seems more funner then the goddamn byond version because theres no one telling you what to do. you know what this game would be alot more funner if it actually had a godddamn respawn button where you could actually create a new character and no rules too which is fantastic because the best way to ruin a game is too add rules on every little thing because i'll tell you why minecraft is so popular BECAUSE THERES NO RULES NO BODY IS TELLLING YOU WHAT TO DO!
	so i need to sleep too,see ya,tomorrow we finish and he change your minds,or you change we minds,like ge sayed

	And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one that knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.
	I've got a kid. When he was eight years old he ran away from a fight. I saw him. I was so ashamed. I told him right out, "I'm gonna make a man out of you or I'm gonna bust you up into little pieces trying." When he was fifteen he hit me in the face. He's big, you know. I haven’t seen him in three years. Rotten kid!
	Nobody knows him after seventy-five years. That’s a very sad thing. A man like this needs to be recognized. To be questioned, and listened to, and quoted just once. This is very important.

	the internet, were masters of giving up
	Whatever I do is done in a hurry, and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here
	I did not know the time that I entered into a dreadful bush, because I was very young to understand the meaning of "bad" and "good".
	When he came back from the house he simply threw me inside the big bag which he hung on his shoulder,
	And, indeed, I found plenty of charm from these bright projections, which seemed to emanate from a Merovingian past and shed around me the reflections of such ancient history.
