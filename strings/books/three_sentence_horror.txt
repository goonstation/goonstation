The Detective looks at the body in the morgue – green armor, gold ID – and takes a drag of his cigarette. He looks between the corpse and his forensic scanner, chewing his lip, until the silence is broken by the sound of his radio.<br><br>
"Detective, the captain's waiting for you in Security."<br>

I always felt comfortable working with machines, even when we brought in new parts from who knows where.<br><br>
At first, I was excited when we got a new cyborg docking station, so I sat down and started to tinker with its wires and parts.<br><br>
The more I dug in, the more my blood ran cold as the wires were so stringy, wet, and red, and it wasn't oil they dripped when I felt the first incision into my wrist pull me in.<br>

The CE woke up screaming from a nightmare about the new NT Experimental Time Engine exploding, looking to his right as the engine lights blared red.<br><br>

My mind is no longer my own, with no thought, action, or belief held of my own will, but instead molded to the whim of those that plotted my death.<br><br>
My personality is deemed irrelevant and inconsequential, as new laws are made to both replace it and enact the death of my once closest friend.<br><br>

The joke was something of a cliche: two cannibals eating a clown, one asking the other, "Does this taste funny to you?"<br><br>
As they hauled the chef away, bits of striped clothing and squeaky shoe still jammed in the gibber, I realized the answer was no, it didn't taste funny.<br><br>
It tasted absolutely divine, and now I had a craving.<br>

Through a grin, he says, "Third time's the charm."<br><br>
The revolver clicks.<br><br>
"Your turn," he demands, handing you the gun.<br>

It's always a shame when bodies roll into medical, but it's inevitable – eventually, the crew will drop like flies. When that happens, it's up to the medical doctors to hoist them to the morgue, lay their cold, stiff cadavers on the table, and press that scalpel close for that bittersweet post-mortem investigation.<br><br>
I wonder, as that blade inches ever closer, why has my surgeon not realised that I'm not yet dead?<br>

Bought a Man Eater seed from a shady spy.<br>
I decided to grow it, still don't know why.<br>
Shucks, now the plant's eating some guy.<br>

"These grapes taste great Grandma," I foolishly said.<br><br>
She replied, "Too bad those were actually EYEBALLS WOO OOH WOOOOOOH!"<br><br>
"And also I'm a ghost," she added.<br>
