<li><b>Matthew: Chapter 25</b></li><li></li>
<li><b>14:</b></li>
<li>	"It will be as when a man who was going on a journey called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.</li>
<li><b>15:</b></li>
<li>	To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one - to each according to his ability. Then he went away. Immediately</li>
<li><b>16:</b></li>
<li>	the one who received five talents went and traded with them, and made another five.</li>
<li><b>17:</b></li>
<li>	Likewise, the one who received two made another two.</li>
<li><b>18:</b></li>
<li>	But the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money.</li>
<li><b>19:</b></li>
<li>	After a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.</li>
<li><b>20:</b></li>
<li>	The one who had received five talents came forward bringing the additional five. He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five more.'</li>
<li><b>21:</b></li>
<li>	His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.'</li>
<li><b>22:</b></li>
<li>	(Then) the one who had received two talents also came forward and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more.'</li>
<li><b>23:</b></li>
<li>	His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.'</li>
<li><b>24:</b></li>
<li>	Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you were a demanding person, harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter;</li>
<li><b>25:</b></li>
<li>	so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground. Here it is back.'</li>
<li><b>26:</b></li>
<li>	His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant and gather where I did not scatter?</li>
<li><b>27:</b></li>
<li>	Should you not then have put my money in the bank so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?</li>
<li><b>28:</b></li>
<li>	Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.</li>
<li><b>29:</b></li>
<li>	For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</li>
<li><b>30:</b></li>
<li>	And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'</li><li></li>
