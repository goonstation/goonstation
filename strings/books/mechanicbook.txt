	<br>
	<br>To connect Components to each other you use drag and drop.
	<br>For this to work the components need to be secured into place by means of a Wrench.
	<br>You need to be holding a multi-Tool to be able to change Connections and Options of Components.
	<br>
	<br>A basic construction would look something like :
	<br><I>Wrench a Button Component into Place.</I>
	<br><I>Wrench a Graviton Accelerator into Place.</I>
	<br><I>Drag the Button onto the Accelerator and drop.</I>
	<br><I>Set the Button as Trigger.</I>
	<br><I>Select the only existing target input on the Accelerator.</I>
	<br>
	<br>Using the Button will now activate the Accelerator.
	<br>
	<br>You can see the Connections between Components when they are not covered by Tiles.
	<br>Just use a Crowbar to reveal the Plating and you'll be able to see what's connected to what.
	<br>
	<br>The Components can also be connected to some Machines and Gadgets around the Station.
	<br>You could try messing around with Doors or vending Machines.
	<br>If you want to connect two non-component objects together - say two Doors,
	<br>you will have to use a Component between the two Objects. Relays are easily used for this.
	<br>You would connect the Relay to Door 1 as Receiver and then connect the Relay to Door 2 as Trigger.
	<br>
	<br>Most Components offer additional Options in their right-Click Menu when you are standing right next to them.
	<br>These Options can range from Rotation to setting the output Signal and such Things.
	<br>
	<br><I>Information about the specific Components follows below.</I>

	<br><BIG><B>Component specific Information</B></BIG>
	<br>
	<br><B>AND Component:</B>
	<br>Sends specified signal when both inputs receive a Signal within a specified Time Frame.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Buffer Component:</B>
	<br>Collects signals in a buffer of a congfigurable size and outputs them with a delay, also configurable.
	<br>There are several buffer modes that can be set, either with a multitool or a component input.
	<br><ul>
	<li> FIFO(First in First Out) outputs the oldest signals first, dropping new signals when the buffer is full. </li>
	<li> FILO(First in Last Out) outputs the newest signals first, dropping new signals when the buffer is full. </li>
	<li> Ring buffer outputs the oldest signals first like FIFO, but signals will replace the oldest signal in the buffer instead of being dropped.</li>
	<li> Random mode outputs signals in a random order, and randomly overwrites signals when the buffer is full. </li>
	</ul>
  <br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Arithmetic Component:</B>
	<br>Store numbers received in signals to variable A or B, then do mathematical operations on them. By default it will compute the result immediately, then send it on as a signal.
	<br>Conveniently strips off trailing letters when setting variables.
	<br>
	<br>There are several options and inputs.
	<ul>
		<li>Set A/Set B: set the variables manually with your multitool, or with with a signal input.</li>
		<li>Evaluate: immediately send a signal with the result of the current mode and variables.</li>
		<li>Set Mode: set the operation to apply to the variables, we'll list these below.
			<br>It can be set by hand or with an input signal.
		<li>Toggle Auto-Evaluate: toggle evaluating automatically when variables are set.</li>
		<li>Toggle Auto-Floor: automatically floor() results to the closest integer
	</ul>

	The following are the modes you can set the component to. Results are passed along as a signal,
	either when setting a variable with a signal, or when an evaluate signal is recieved.
	<ul>
		<li>Add: Finds the sum of A and B.</li>
		<li>Sub: Subtracts B from A.</li>
		<li>Div: Divides A by B, errors if B is zero.</li>
		<li>Mul: Multiplies A and B.</li>
		<li>Mod: Finds the modulus (remainder) of A divided by B.</li>
		<li>Pow: Power. Gets the result of A to exponent B.</li>
		<li>Rng: Gets a random number between A and B.</li>
		<li>Gt/lt: Greater than, less than. Returns 1 if A is greater than or less than B, respectively. Otherwise returns 0.
			<br>You'll need a signal check component after this.</li>
		<li>Gte/lte: Greater than or equal/less than or equal. Same as above but also triggers on equality.</li>
		<li>Eq: Equal. Returns 1 if A and B are equal, 0 if not.</li>
		<li>Neq: Not equal. Opposite of equal.</li>
		<li>Min: Returns A or B, whichever is smaller.</li>
		<li>Max: Like min but returns whichever is larger.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Button:</B>
	<br>Sends set Signal when used.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Delay Component:</B>
	<br>Delays an incoming signal a certain amount of time before sending it to its connections.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Dispatch Component:</B>
	<br>Match signals like a signal-check component on a per-device basis. The dispatch component is unique in that when an outgoing connection is made, it will ask for a comma delimited list, for example
	<br>
	<br><tt>apples, oranges</tt>
	<br>
	<br>When signals are dispatched through the component, it will apply these per-connection filters. In the previous example, any signal containing apples or oranges would pass through.
	With a multitool, two options can be enabled: exact match, and single output.
	<br>Exact match mode will only signals that are identical to the filter, in the previous example, only the literal signals <tt>apples</tt> or <tt>oranges</tt> would pass.
	Single output mode does not affect filtering, but instead, will only pass a signal to the first matching connection, from oldest to newest.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Signal Dispatch Component:</B>
	<br>The signal dispatch works identically to the dispatch component above, but rather than acting like a signal check, the filters are taken as a list of parmeters to be split identically to the signal split component.
	When a given signal is split, the value of the parmeter is sent to the matching connection instead of the complete signal. Take this signal:
	<br>
	<br><tt>data=I am the data key;message=I am the message key</tt><br>
	<br>A connection matching <tt>data</tt> would recieve a signal with the message <tt>I am the data key</tt>. For more information on this format, see the wifi splitter section of this book.
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Microphone Component:</B>
	<br>Forwards nearby speech as signal.
	<br>The "Toggle Show-Source" option determines whether the component adds the source's name to the signal or not.
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br><B>RegEx Find Component:</B>
	<br>Attempts to find an expression within a String. If found it can either forward the found String as Signal or send its own Signal.
	<br>The type of RegEx used is PCRE. Look-ahead or look-behind assertions are not supported.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>RegEx Replace Component:</B>
	<br>Attempts to find an expression within a String and then replaces it. Forwards the modified String as Signal. Also has an Input that lets you set the Expression.
	<br>The type of RegEx used is PCRE. Look-ahead or look-behind assertions are not supported.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Relay Component:</B>
	<br>Forwards an input signal to another Target. If Signal changing is enabled, the Component will change the incoming Signal to its own before relaying it.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Selection Component:</B>
	<br>Holds a List of Signals that can be manipulated, browsed and sent.

	<br><B>Signal Builder Component:</B>
	<br>Builds a String out of incoming Signals until it is triggered to send whats in the Buffer at which point the accumulated String will be sent and the Buffer cleared.
	<br>The starting/ending String Settings allow you to define a String that will be put at the Beginning or End of each String.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Signal Check Component:</B>
	<br>Sends either its own Signal or the input Signal when it receives a Signal that has the set Trigger String in it somewhere.  Can be toggled to trigger when it does NOT find the specified string.

	<br><B>Sound Synthesizer:</B>
	<br>Speaks whatever Signal it receives out loud. Rate-limited to 2 Seconds.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Teleport Component:</B>
	<br>To link Pads set the ID to the same string on both Pads. If there are more than 2 Pads with the same ID, Destinations will be picked at random.
	<br>Has an Input that allows a message to change the ID of the Pad and through that its Destination.
	<br>Individual Pads can be set to send only Mode - in this Mode they can not be the Target Location of other Pads with the same ID.
	<br>This is useful if you want to have several Pads teleport to one exit Pad.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Toggle Component:</B>
	<br>Can be turned on, off or be toggled. Outputs 2 different Signals depending on its new State - one for on and one for off.
	<br>Can also be triggered to just output the appropriate Signal without doing anything else.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Wifi Component:</B>
	<br>The "send radio message" Command accepts Messages in the Format of command=herp&data=derp which will then be sent on the set Frequency.
	<br>The Component can receive a sendmsg Radio Signal that will send the Data in the \"data\" Portion of the Signal to the Outputs of this Component.
	<br>Following the previous Syntax a sendmsg Signal would look like this : address_1=WIFICompoAddHere&command=sendmsg&data=MyCompoCommand
	<br>Normal PDA Messages can also be used to trigger the Component.
	<br>The frequency can be changed wirelessly as well by using the setfreq Command : address_1=WIFICompoAddHere&command=setfreq&data=1419
	<br>If you enable the forward all option, the Component will forward any Radio Messages it receives, unprocessed and in the above format, to its Outputs.
	<br>By disabling NetID filtering you can make the Component react to any and all Radio Messages on its frequency.
	<br>The Component will blink green when it receives a wireless Message and blink red when it sends a wireless Message."
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Wifi Signal Splitter Component:</B>
	<br>Returns the value of a field within a Radio signal. The components Trigger Field is the Field you want the Value of.
	<br>For example: Set the Trigger Field to \"user_id\". When a Signal with \"user_id=captain\" arrives the Component forwards \"captain\"
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><B>Movement Component:</B>
	<br>This component can only be deployed inside a component cabinet. It will allow the cabinet to move by it's own power.
	<br>For this it has two possible inputs:
	<br>"step" will make the cabinet take a single step in the given direction.
	<br>"walk" will make the cabinet walk in the given direction until it is stopped.
	<br>The speed of the cabinet can also be configured.
	<br>Directions can be given as numbers or text
	<br>Stopping is done via 0
