		Howdy! Welcome to the wild world of minin'! You're tasked with getting the station valuable minerals they need by digging them up, either in space or with the mineral magnet.
		But, there's some important information for greenhorns like you to know; we wouldn't want you drifting into space like a tumbleweed!

		<h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
		Different mining equipment will be more or less effective on different densities of rock.  Try 'em all!
		<br>
		In your locker, you'll find:<br>
		<ul><li><b>Power Pick</b> - basic tool for digging, holds 50 charges and needs to be recharged after those are spent.</li>
		<li><b>Engineering Space Suit and Jetpack</b>- basic EVA gear essential to safely operate in space, does not protect from radiation. Remember to turn your oxygen on when you venture out!</li>
		<li><b>Low Yield Concussive Charges</b> - mining explosives to mine large areas, slap them onto an asteroid and get the heck outta the way!</li>
		<li><b>Ore scoop and Satchels</b> - connect a satchel to the scoop, and it will automatically pick up all useful minerals you walk over when you hold it in a hand. Each satchel can
		hold 50 pieces of ore before being full up.</li>
		<li><b>Geologic Scanner</b> - scans an asteroid for ore types, sweet gems, as well as points out any dangers, hinderances, or anomalies in the rock.</li></ul>
		<br><h4>OTHER GEAR</h4>
		These can be manufactured in your workspace once you've collected some materials to make 'em. Visit the yellow Mining Fabricator to create these.
		<ul><li><b>Power Hammer</b> - a more powerful mining tool, but holds less charges. Hits rocks in a three-tile row in front of you.</li>
		<li><b>Laser Drill</b> - a medium-powered mining tool that doesn't need charges.</li>
		<li><b>Concussive Charges</b> - work the same as the low yield ones from before, but with a larger radius.</li>
		<li><b>Industrial Armour/Suit</b> - space and diving suits that protect from radiation and explosions, both common hazards in this line of work.</li>
		<li><b>Mechanized Boots</b> - shoes that allow for much faster movement. </li></ul>
		<br><i>You can also make custom tools in the Nanofabricator (Mining) by loading bars of refined materials into it and then producing a tool head; then loading the tool head into the
		machine and producing a Mining Tool. Experiment with different material combinations to discover more effective means of mining.</i><br>
		<h3>DEPARTMENT MACHINES</h3>
		<ul><li><b>Nanofabricator (Mining)</b> - makes most mining gear (and some other stuff) when supplied with ore.</li>
		<li><b>Mineral Magnet</b> - a big honkin' circular device that pulls in asteroids from space. Operated from the purple-screened Mining Magnet Control computer located near the rest of
		the machinery. It can also scan the rock for you like the Geologic Scanner can. Yahoo!</li>
		<li><b>Quantum Telescope</b> - a high-tech long range telescope that allows you to find better and rare ore. It works via triangulatin' a signal based on points you click on the computer.
		<ul><li>Click an asteroid to track on the right of the computer screen, and then click the image of the galaxy. <b><i>A larger circle means you're further away from the asteroid you're trying to
		find.</b></i></li><li><i>You can save asteroids to the Mining Magnet Control computer and pull them up at the Control computer.</i></li></ul>
		<li><b>Nanocrucible</b> - makes alloys out of two refined mineral chunks, combining their properties. </li>
		<li><b>Nanofabrictors</b> - makes special gear out of refined minerals, like metal sheets and lightbulbs.</li></ul>
		<h3>MATERIALS</h3>
		Now, a basic rundown of what you'll find out there:
		<br>
		<br>Mauxite - Standard metal, easily mined with even a unpowered pickaxe.
		<br>
		<br>Pharosium - Standard Conductor, easily mined with even a unpowered pickaxe.
		<br>
		<br>Molitz - Standard Crystal, easily mined.
		<br>
		<br>Borhum - Sturdy metal, useful and easy to mine.
		<br>
		<br>Claretine - High power conductor, required to make improved gear!
		<br>
		<br>Cerenkite - Power source!, take caution when mining, as it is also incredibly radioactive.
		<br>
		<br>This is not an exhaustive list of all ores you can find, you may come accross more while mining, but these are some of the most useful!
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>COWORKERS</h3>
		<br>
		Minin' can be a huge help to other departments, so let's get to know 'em!
		<br>
		Your boss, the Chief Engineer, keeps the station running!  Listen to them if they have any orders, but generally they'll be more concerned with the engine.
		<br>
		The Quartermasters will LOVE you if you send them those juicy ores and gems, and you'll help boost the station budget so y'all can afford some fancy hats!  Yeehaw!
		<br>
		Robotics can also use ores and gems, and sending some over is appreciated! You can do this by sendin' them in a crate usin' a cargo transporter and settin' the destination to the Robotics or Cargo pads.
		<br>
		You can also sell ore to anyone on the station by placin' your satchel on that big round orange thing somewhere near the magnet or in the minin' room. That's the RockBox! It saves all ores you collect and can dispense 'em to the different fabricators throughout the station. To sell ores from the RockBox, jus' open up the interface on it and set the ores to 'For sale' by clickin' next to them in the listin'. You can set your own prices too!
		<br>

		<h3>DANGERS</h3>
		Life isn't all fun and games on the mining frontier!  Here's some stuff to watch out for:

		<ul><li>WEAR YOUR DANG SPACE SUIT AND PUT YOUR OXYGEN ON; YOU WILL DIE OUT THERE IF YOU DON'T, YOU DARN FOOL!</li>
		<li>Your Oxygen can run out!  If you see a little red O2 icon pop up and you start gasping, get inside and take that jetpack off, it's done!
		<ul><li>Stick it on an air or oxygen canister, pump up the pressure, and flick the switch, should fill 'er up!</li></ul></li>
		<li>Ore that is <i><b>radioactive</b></i> like Erebite and Cerenkite. This means a lot of hard-to-heal damage over time. If you stop feelin' well and see you're injured by
		looking at the top right,  STOP what you are doing and get to a doc, pronto!</li>
		<li><b><i>Explosive</b></i> ore, like Erebite Your friend and enemy!  Some ore is pretty naturally volatile, and will go 'BOOM' unless handled carefully!
		There's also sometimes pockets of gas that will glow briefly before detonating. <b>If you see a glow, it's time ta go!</b>
		<ul><li>Keep an eye out for areas marked with a red '!' when you scan that sucker.</li></ul></li></ul>

		We at Nanotrasen hope you find this information helpful and that you'll have more fun mining than a baby bee in a butter bucket!  Now get out there and get that ore. Good luck!
