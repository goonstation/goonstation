	<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
		<li>1) There are themed sets of cards that work great in combination with one another! Try to build your deck around that!</li>
		<li>2) Tap your equipment, effect or even the boards area card to differentiate between creatures!</li>
		<li>3) Cards which are face-down on the table can surprise your opponent!</li>
		<li>4) Just because a creature died and has to be put on your discard pile does not mean it is out of the game yet!</li>
		<li>5) Keep some dice nearby. Some cards might require a bit of luck!</li>
		<li>6) Buy more cards! Spend your cash!</li>
