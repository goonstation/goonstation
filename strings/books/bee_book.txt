<h1 id="chapter-one-hatching-bees">Chapter One: Hatching Bees</h1>
<p>While you may at times find Bees already buzzing around happily, often you will have to hatch them. To do this, pick up the Bee egg carton and open it, then using your other hand carefully extract the Bee egg inside. At this point, you can use a pen on the egg to name your Bee - Bees have an innate knowledge of their name if given in this manner. Then, you simply warm the egg in your hand, and out will pop an adorable Bee larva. Give them a little pat and let them explore - they're very curious little fellows! If they start chewing on your clothes too much, gently bop them with some rolled up paper and tell them no. Soon, they'll grow up into a full sized Bee!</p>
<p>There are rumors of other methods of hatching Bees, such as sneezing them out. While very silly, there may be some truth to these, so keep an ear out for interesting rumors!</p>
