Mid Year's resolutions are just as good as New Year's. If I'm starting a business, I'll have to learn to be orderly and meticulous. And ambitious and disciplined and hardworking and professional and all that.

I understand that my whole business scheme is rather novel, but I really do think it will exceed expectations by leaps and bounds. I've already put in an order for two seal pups with the Sustainable Sea Network. Things are going well.

They told me that seal pups are actually cheaper this time of season, due to heat waves and rising sea levels, leading to many seal pup orphans. I don't know how to feel about that.

I was too busy yesterday. Apparently there were some licenses that I overlooked, and so I had to fill out applications all day. Who knew managing a zoo would take this much work?

This weird guy came by my house yesterday and asked if I had any brullbars. It's been a bit since high school german, but I've never heard of a howler bear before. I dont like the feeling of that question though.

They told me to expect three to four business days for the seal pups. I'm worried. I know they get air holes and everything, but still.

Okay, these definitely aren't seal pups. They're white, yes, but they look distinctly humanoid and not cute. And they moan. I'll have to file for a refund.

God. Ever since that guy came to my house again... He didn't even say anything! Just smiled like a creepy ass. Everything's gone to shit since then.

I'm being taken somewhere. I can feel it. Piece by piece, particle by particle, every day... Marie's telling me that I just need new meds, but I know she's wrong.

<BR>I am <i>not</i> going to run this zoo. No matter how much they try to convince me. Not like this, not with these things!
