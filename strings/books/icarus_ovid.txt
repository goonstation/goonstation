<p>In tedious Exile now too long detain'd,<br>
Daedalus languish'd for his native Land:<br>
The Sea foreclos'd his Flight; yet thus he said;<br>
Tho' Earth and Water in Subjection laid,<br>
O cruel Minos, thy Dominion be,<br>
We'll go thro' Air; for sure the Air is free.<br>
Then to new Arts his cunning Thought applies,<br>
And to improve the Work of Nature tries.<br>
A Row of Quills in gradual Order plac'd,<br>
Rise by Degrees in Length from first to last;<br>
As on a Cliff th' ascending Thicket grows,<br>
Or, different Reeds the rural Pipe compose.<br>
Along the Middle runs a Twine of Flax,<br>
The Bottom Stems are joyn'd by pliant Wax.<br>
Thus, well compact, a hollow Bending brings<br>
The fine Composure into real Wings.</p>

<p>His Boy, young Icarus, that near him stood,<br>
Unthinking of his Fate, with Smiles pursu'd<br>
The floating Feathers, which the moving Air<br>
Bore loosely from the Ground, and wafted here and there.<br>
Or with the Wax impertinently play'd,<br>
And with his childish Tricks the great Design delay'd.<br>
The final Master-stroke at last impos'd,<br>
And now, the neat Machine compleatly clos'd;<br>
Fitting his Pinions, on a Flight he tries,<br>
And hung self-ballanc'd in the beaten Skies.<br>
Then thus instructs his Child; My Boy, take Care<br>
To wing your Course along the middle Air;<br>
If low, the Surges wet your flagging Plumes,<br>
If high, the Sun the melting Wax consumes:<br>
Steer between both: Nor to the Northern Skies,<br>
Nor South Orion turn your giddy Eyes;<br>
But follow me: Let me before you lay<br>
Rules for the Flight, and mark the pathless Way.<br>
Then teaching, with a fond Concern, his Son,<br>
He took the untry'd Wings, and fix'd 'em on;<br>
But fix'd with trembling Hands; and, as he speaks,<br>
The Tears roul gently down his aged Cheeks.<br>
Then kiss'd, and in his Arms embrac'd him fast,<br>
But knew not this Embrace must be the last.<br>
And mounting upward, as he wings his Flight,<br>
Back on his Charge he turns his aking Sight;<br>
As Parent Birds, when first their callow Care<br>
Leave the high Nest to tempt the liquid Air.<br>
Then chears him on, and oft, with fatal Art,<br>
Reminds the Stripling to perform his Part.</p>

<p>These, as the Angler at the silent Brook,<br>
Or Mountain-Shepherd leaning on his Crook,<br>
Or gaping Plowman from the Vale descries,<br>
They stare, and view 'em with religious Eyes,<br>
And strait conclude 'em Gods; since none, but they,<br>
Thro' their own azure Skies cou'd find a Way.<br>
Now Delos, Paros on the Left are seen,<br>
And Samos, favour'd by Jove's haughty Queen;<br>
Upon the Right, the Isle Lebynthos nam'd,<br>
And fair Calymne for its Honey fam'd.<br>
When now the Boy, whose childish Thoughts aspire<br>
To loftier Aims, and make him ramble higher,<br>
Grown wild and wanton, more embolden'd flies<br>
Far from his Guide, and soars among the Skies.<br>
The soft'ning Wax, that felt a nearer Sun,<br>
Dissolv'd apace, and soon began to run.<br>
The Youth in vain his melting Pinions shakes,<br>
His Feathers gone, no longer Air he takes:<br>
Oh! Father, Father, as he strove to cry,<br>
Down to the Sea he tumbled from on high,<br>
And found his Fate; yet still subsists by Fame,<br>
Among those Waters that retain his Name.<br>
The Father, now no more a Father, cries,<br>
Ho Icarus! where are you? as he flies;<br>
Where shall I seek my Boy? he cries again,<br>
And saw his Feathers scatter'd on the Main.<br>
Then curs'd his Art; and fun'ral Rites confer'd,<br>
Naming the Country from the Youth interr'd.<br>
A Partridge, from a neighb'ring Stump, beheld<br>
The Sire his monumental Marble build;<br>
Who, with peculiar Call, and flutt'ring Wing,<br>
Chirpt joyful, and malicious seem'd to sing:</p>

<p>The only Bird of all its Kind, and late<br>
Transform'd in Pity to a feather'd State:<br>
From whence, O Daedalus, thy Guilt we date.<br>
His Sister's Son, when now twelve Years were past,<br>
Was, with his Uncle, as a Scholar plac'd;<br>
The unsuspecting Mother saw his Parts,<br>
And Genius fitted for the finest Arts.<br>
This soon appear'd; for when the spiny Bone<br>
In Fishes Backs was by the Stripling known,<br>
A rare Invention thence he learnt to draw,<br>
Fil'd Teeth in Iron, and made the grating Saw.<br>
He was the first, that from a Knob of Brass<br>
Made two strait Arms with widening Stretch to pass;<br>
That, while one stood upon the Center's Place,<br>
The other round it drew a circling Space.<br>
Daedalus envy'd this, and from the Top<br>
Of fair Minerva's Temple let him drop;<br>
Feigning that, as he lean'd upon the Tow'r,<br>
Careless he stoop'd too much, and tumbled o'er.<br>
The Goddess, who th' Ingenious still befriends,<br>
On this Occasion her Assistance lends;<br>
His Arms with Feathers, as he fell, she veils,<br>
And in the Air a new-made Bird he sails.<br>
The Quickness of his Genius, once so fleet,<br>
Still in his Wings remains, and in his Feet:<br>
Still, tho' transform'd, his ancient Name he keeps,<br>
And with low Flight the new-shorn Stubble sweeps.<br>
Declines the lofty Trees, and thinks it best<br>
To brood in Hedge-rows o'er it's humble Nest;<br>
And, in Remembrance of the former Ill,<br>
Avoids the Heights and Precipices still.</p>

<p>At length, fatigu'd with long laborious Flights,<br>
On fair Sicilia's Plains the Artist lights;<br>
Where Cocalus the King, that gave him Aid,<br>
Was, for his Kindness, with Esteem repaid.<br>
Athens no more her doleful Tribute sent,<br>
That Hardship gallant Theseus did prevent;<br>
Their Temples hung with Garlands, they adore<br>
Each friendly God, but most Minerva's Pow'r:<br>
To her, to Jove, to All, their Altars smoak,<br>
They each with Victims and Perfumes invoke.<br>
Now talking Fame, thro' every Graecian Town,<br>
Had spread, immortal Theseus, thy Renown.<br>
From him, the neighb'ring Nations in Distress,<br>
In suppliant Terms implore a kind Redress.</p>
