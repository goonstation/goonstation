	<h1>SPATIAL INTERDICTOR ASSEMBLY AND USE</h1>

	<h2>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</h2>
	<br>
	Congratulations on your recent acquisition or allocation of cutting-edge interdiction technology!
	<br>
	<br>
	Using the power of yottahertz-range electromagnetic counter-interference, the Spatial Interdictor provides robust protection against a wide array of stellar phenomena:
	<br>
	<br>
	Biomagnetic fields nulled on discharge
	<br>
	Black holes semi-stabilized, increasing time to respond*
	<br>
	Radiation pulses safely remodulated within field range
	<br>
	Radiation storms fully deflected from field area**
	<br>
	Solar flare disruptions reduced per onboard interdictor
	<br>
	Spatial tears stabilized, permitting limited traversal***
	<br>
	Unstable wormholes nulled when entry is attempted
	<br>
	<br>
	<i>*WARNING: total interdiction impossible, and device must be active beforehand.</i>
	<br>
	<i>**WARNING: heavy interdiction cost. An adequate grid supply MUST be present for reliable deflection, and a high-capacity cell is recommended.</i>
	<br>
	<i>***ADVISORY: as a countermeasure to capacitance failure, interdicting spatial tears will require reinitializing the interdictor if it was not installed near the tear at the time of the event.</i>
	<br>
	<br>
	In just a few short steps, worrying about the myriad hazards of space will be a thing of the past!^
	<br>
	<br>
	<i>^Please be aware that no liability is assumed for failure to interdict any events absent from or present within the aforementioned list. Physical hazards such as meteor storms will not be interdicted.</i>

	<h3>MAINBOARD SELECTION</h3>
	<br>
	The spatial interdictor's mainboard manages current flow into the phase-control rod, and several variants are available for your manufacture.
	<br>
	Some of these variants are more costly to manufacture, but will provide additional secondary functionality of benefit to station operations. The following schematics are included:
	<br>
	<br>
	Standard Mainboard: Cheapest selection. No additional functionality, but grants one additional standard unit of radius.
	<br>
	Nimbus Mainboard: Provides over-the-air recharging to cyborgs in range. Recommended for use in industrial circumstances where sensitive equipment is present and uptime is crucial.
	<br>
	Zephyr Mainboard: Creates a bioelectric field within the standard operating radius, with beneficial* effects on human physiology, primarily reflected as an improvement in stamina.
	<br>
	Devera Mainboard: Ionizes atmosphere within field bounds. Has a suppressive effect on exposed bacteria, with particular efficacy at containing miasma.
	<br>
	<br>
	<i>*Please consult station physicians before use.</i>
	<br>

	<h3>ASSEMBLING THE DEVICE</h3>
	<br>
	(I) Fabricate the frame kit, mainboard and phase-control rod at any manufacturer using the drive included with your interdictor crate. Materials not provided.
	<br>
	Phase control rods may be manufactured in Lambda, Sigma, Epsilon and Phi configurations.
	<br>
	Lambda and Sigma rods are recommended for typical operation; Lambda rods cover a four-unit radius, while the advanced but more materially complex Sigma rods cover a six-unit radius.
	<br>
	For circumstances where fine-tuning is advantageous, Epsilon and Phi rods are designed for prioritized radius or prioritized power efficiency respectively.
	<br>
	Epsilon rods provide a greater radius (ten units) but expend approximately 180% of normal cost, while Phi rods provide a reduced radius (two units) but expend approximately 60% of normal cost.
	<br>
	<i>Use of non-standard phase-control rods is not supported in this guide. Please consult a Nanotrasen certified engineer for a custom interdiction solution, including appropriate power cell.</i>
	<br>
	<br>
	(II) Gather the following equipment before assembly:
	<br>
	- Interdictor frame kit
	<br>
	- Nanotrasen standard diameter wrench
	<br>
	- Interdictor mainboard of your choice
	<br>
	- Interdictor phase-control rod
	<br>
	- Industry-compliant power cell (high-capacity heavily recommended, as installation is permanent)
	<br>
	- Four lengths of industry-compliant electrical cable
	<br>
	- Screwdriver (magnetic acceptable; however, installation using a rotary bit is not recommended)
	<br>
	- Four sheets of industry-compliant steel
	<br>
	<br>
	(III) Assemble objects using the sequence listed in the enumeration. Once assembled, the device may be transported to the site of utilisation to be connected and activated.
	<br>

	<h3>USING THE DEVICE</h3>
	<br>
	Due to the advanced technologies incorporated into the Spatial Interdictor's mainboard, it will automatically begin operating when conditions are suitable.
	<br>
	<br>
	Suitable conditions are: Adequate internal cell charge (70% of capacity or greater), presence of an area power controller, and active magnetic anchoring.
	<br>
	<br>
	For charging or operation, activate magnetic anchoring by touching the control pad located on the front side of the rectangular regulator unit.
	<br>
	<br>
	Interdictors are by default configured to replenish up to one hundred of their cell units per cycle (placing 50,000 watts of load on area power systems);
	<br>
	authorized users may increase or decrease this rate limitation as desired with a multi-tool, though this should not be necessary with super-capacity power cells.
	<br>
	<br>
	For safety purposes, activating or deactivating magnetic anchoring requires the user to possess an identification card with at least base-level Engineering access.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Spatial Interdictor is equipped with three distinct indicators, each representing a different aspect of its functionality:
	<br>
	<br>
	- The charge meter, located on the side of the interdiction pillar. This represents the current capacity of the buffer cell; while all three segments are illuminated, the interdictor is ready to operate.
	<br>
	<br>
	- The interdiction emitter, located on the top of the interdiction pillar. While illuminated, the Interdictor is currently active and protecting its surroundings.
	<br>
	<br>
	- The grid-tie indicator, located on the front of the regulator unit. Illumination means the Interdictor is correctly installed, and able to charge, or activate if charged.
