<font face=Georgia color=black size='3'> THE TRIAL OF HEISENBEE<BR>
A children&#39;s book by F. Briner:<BR>
<BR>
Heisenbee had done a very bad crime in the animal courtroom, he stung Albert the Monkey without warning and that made Albert very sad.<BR>
<BR>
Albert the Monkey had asked the owl police, which was headed by Hooty McJudgementowl, to arrest Heisenbee, which is a very mean thing to do to a bee!<BR>
<BR>
The owl jury stood silent as Heisenbee&#39;s lawyer, a fresh-faced monkey by the name of Tanhony and a voice the sound of horses running wild entered the courtroom.<BR>
<BR>
Heisenbee buzzed questioningly at the judge! The judge, his Honor Muggles screeched back Heisenbee&#39;s terrible and awful crimes! Tanhony asked Heisenbee to remain quiet.<BR>
<BR>
The mammalian Jury grew restless, Jones the cat hissed at the mouse, who was taking notes of the proceedings. Tanhony gave his appeal to the animal Jury.<BR>
<BR>
The brothers gnome, Chompski and Chompski, were not convinced and voted Heisenbee guilty of attempted murder! Which was very bad for Heisenbee!<BR>
<BR>
The owls stood silent, which as we a </font><font face=Georgia color=black size='3'> ll know means that they knew in their hearts of hearts that Heisenbee was guilty.<BR>
<BR>
The mammalian jury was silent, having just convinced the cockroach that Heisenbee was not like other bugs and was in fact guilty.<BR>
<BR>
Heisenbee buzzed in panic, and buzzed angrily at Tanhony! He was led off the premises by Franklin Briner the Chief Engineer. THE END </font>
