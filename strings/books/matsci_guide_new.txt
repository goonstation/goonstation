  <section id="MatSci-W"><h3>Materials Science: What is it, Where is it, and Why is it?</h3></section>
<hr>
The field of Materials Science is long studied and long storied. To detail precisely the extensive history of this field would require a tome all on its own, and we will instead focus not on what has been done in the field, but what there is yet to do.
<br><br>
An aspiring metallurgist requires a suitable workshop in which they can create and refine alloys. Recommended for this line of work are:
<ul><li><b>Nano-Crucible</b> - a large cuboid forge that melts two materials and reforms them as an alloyed bar
<ul><li>Usage may produce slag and so it is recommended that you use a slag shovel to clean out the Smelter in between creating each alloy</li></ul>
<ul>
</ul><b>Slag Shovel</b> - used for removing slag buildup from impurities removed in the refining process. Modern Nano-Crucibles are able to filter impurities with more accuracy and so the old practice of slag shovelling has fallen by the wayside.
</li></ul><ul><b>Material Processer</b> - a machine with a rectangular surface and two clamps to hold bars of alloys in place; used to process raw ores and gems into more workable ingots
</li></ul><ul><b>Nano-Fabricator</b> - the sibling machine of the Material Processor with two upright arms embedded with lasers that will precisely cut and mold your materials into any of the pre-loaded schematics
<ul><li>Nano-Fabricator schematics describe needing either metal alloys, fabrics, rubber, or crystals, but it is possible for a single bar of alloyed material to possess all the properties needed for a schematic to begin working
<li> You can store and view your stored materials under the “Storage” tab</li>
<li>You can automatically store projects you make in the Nano-Fabricator by setting output to the Nano-Fabricator under the “Settings” tab</li>
</li></ul><b>Material Analyzer</b> - a green handheld device that reports the information of a material including electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, hardness, density, stability, and others. See "An Index of Properties and Their Effects" section below.
</ul>
<ul><b>Arc Electroplater</b> - a machine that allows for you to place a material in an electrolyte bath and then place an object into the bath to transfer the electrolyzed material to the surface of the object.
<ul><li>This allows for transfer of material properties to objects you cannot make through the Nano-Fabricator. Particularly of interest in thermo-electric systems.</li></ul>
</ul></ul><br>
The reasons for partaking in metallurgy are numerous and varied. You can, for example, create new types of walls and floorings with high reflectivity for defense from energy projectiles, which might be desirable in sensitive areas like an AI Core.
<br><br>You may have an interest in producing infused jumpsuits that actively release small amounts of healing chemicals to patients who need long-term and intensive medical care (please consult with licensed medical professionals if you are considering implementing this).
<br><br>
You can generate more protective spacewear for when you are working on highly dangerous projects outside of the station.
Materials Science is infinitely useful.

Alloying is done in the Nano-Crucible using processed materials. When you alloy two materials together, the stats of the created alloy is an average of the two progenitor materials. So, if you were looking to create a dense material and you alloyed Plasmasteel (density 75) with Viscerite (density 65), the resulting alloy would have a density of 70.
When you alloy a material, the material passes on any unique properties to the resulting alloy.<br><br>

Two additional notes on how <b>Melee Damage Protection</b> and <b><i>Ranged Damage Protection</i></b> are determined on wearables. Melee Damage Protection is equal to the density of the material the piece is made from divided by 17.
<b><i>Ranged Damage Protection</i></b> is equal to (material density divided by 17) divided by 10, and then 0.1 is added to the resulting number.

<br><br>So if you had a Plasmasteel alloy at 70 density, it would provide 4 <b><i>Melee Damage Protection</b></i> (70/17 = 4.1) when made into a wearable, and 0.5 <b><i>Ranged Damage Protection</b></i> (0.4+0.1) when made into a wearable.
<br>
<br>
You can directly transfer the stats of a material to an object by putting the material in the <b>Arc Electroplater</b> and then putting the desired object in with the plating. This process takes a few moments, and results in an object that is plated in and has the properties of your material.
