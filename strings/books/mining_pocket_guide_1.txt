		You are tasked with getting the station valuable minerals they need by digging them up, either in space or with the mineral magnet.
		<br>
		<b>You will be given standard:</b>
		<br>
		A power pick - Basic tool for digging, holds 50 charges and needs to be recharged after those are spent.
		<br>
		A engineering space suit and jetpack - Basic EVA gear, does not protect from radiation.
		<br>
		3 Low yield concussive charges - Low power mining explosives, slap them onto an asteroid and run to mine large areas at once.
		<br>
		An ore scoop and 2 ore satchels - Connect a satchel to the scoop, and it will automatically pick up all useful minerals you walk over!, each satchel can hold 50 pieces of ore before being full up.
		<br>
		A geological scanner - Scans an asteroid for ore types and dangers.
		<br>
		<br><b>Other gear may include:</b>
		<br>Power hammer - More powerful mining tool, but holds less charges.
		<br>Concussive charges - Works the same as before, but with a larger radius.
		<br>Industrial space armour - Space suits that protect from radiation and explosions, both common hazards in this line of work.
		<br>Mechanized boots - Shoes that allow for much faster movement.
		<br>Laser drill - Mining tool that doesn't need charges.
		<br>Now, a basic rundown on what you will be mining:
		<br>Mauxite - Standard metal, easily mined with even a unpowered pickaxe.
		<br>Pharosium - Standard Conductor, easily mined with even a unpowered pickaxe.
		<br>Molitz - Standard Crystal, easily mined.
		<br>Borhum - Sturdy metal, useful and easy to mine.
		<br>Claretine - High power conductor, required to make improved gear!
		<br>Cerenkite - Power source!, take caution when mining, as it is also incredibly radioactive.
		<br>This is not an exhaustive list of all ores you can find, you may come accross more while mining, but these are some of the most useful!
		<br>Next up, there's the machinery you'll need to understand.
		<br>Mining fabricator - Makes most mining gear (And some other stuff) when supplied with ore.
		<br>Mineral magnet - Pulls in asteroids from space for you to mine. Operated from the mineral magnet computer located near the rest of the machinery.
		<br>Quantum telescope - High tech telescope that allows you to find better and rare ore, through a triangulation system.
		<br>Arc smelter - Makes alloys out of two refined mineral chunks, combining there properties.
		<br>Nanofabrictors - Makes special gear out of refined minerals, like metal sheets and lightbulbs.
