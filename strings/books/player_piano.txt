<h1>Everything You Need To Know About The Player Piano</h1>

<hr>

<p>This book is meant to give you an idea of how to work the player piano.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>Your player piano takes raw text that you input through the interface and turns it into notes!</p>
<p>A note will play approximately every half second.</p>
<p>You can enable looping on the piano by using the piano key!</p>
<p>The piano key will also let you reset everything on the piano (like a factory reset) if something goes really crazy.</p>

<p>You can use either format, though mixing formats is <b>not</b> allowed.</p>

<h3>Classic Format</h3>

<p>A "note" in the player piano has four parts, each separated by a comma:</p>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
<li>The Note Name</li>
<li>Accidentals</li>
<li>Dynamics</li>
<li>Octave</li>
</ul>

<p>Each note "cluster" needs to be separated by a vertical pipe, like so: A,B,F,3|B,B,F,3</p>

<p>Note Name: Either A,B,C,D,E,F or G if you want to play a note, or R if you don't. (IMPORTANT: READ FURTHER FOR HOW TO REST)</p>

<p>Accidentals: B for flat, S for sharp, N for natural.</p>

<p>Dynamics: P for piano (quietest), MP for mezzo piano, N for neutral, MF for mezzo forte and F for forte (loudest).</p>

<p>Octave: Notes can be on one of three octaves: 3, 4 or 5. 3 is low, 5 is high. The only exception is G Sharp, which can only be 3 or 4.</p>

<p>If you want a note to be a rest, you'll need to put an R in for every field on the note: (R,R,R,R|)</p>

<h3>Compact Format</h3>

<code style="background: #ddd; padding: 3px 5px; border-radius: 4px;">F2N|R|R|R|d3N|R|d3N|R|d4N|a3N|R|d3N|c3N|R|c3N|R</code>

<p>Each note has three characters, with vertical bars separating them.</p>

<p>Rests are a single letter, R/r, that may be followed by a number to indicate multiple rests which go from R1 to R9999.</p>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
<li>First character is the note name and accidental</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
    <li>Uppercase means a sharp note, no (explicit) flats</li>
    <li>Lowercase means natural</li>
	</ul>
<li>Second character is the octave number</li>
<li>Third character is the dynamic</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
    <li>N/n are natural</li>
    <li>P/F are piano/forte</li>
    <li>p/f are mezzo piano/mezzo forte</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Very Compact Format</h3>

<code style="background: #ddd; padding: 3px 5px; border-radius: 4px;">}32V{T{V{X{V{T{Q{T|3O|3O{Q{A{T|3X{V{X{[{C{]{[{X{</code>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
<li>Notes are a single character</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
    <li>There are 88 keys on a piano</li>
    <li>Characters go from 33 (!) to 120 (x), with each character representing a key</li>
	</ul>
<li>Rests have four variants</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
    <li>Numbered variants indicate multiple rests</li>
    <li>`{` is one rest</li>
    <li>`|#` is a rest with one digit</li>
    <li>`}##` is a rest with two digits</li>
    <li>`~###` is a rest with three digits</li>
	</ul>
<li>Does not support dynamics</li>
<li>There are no delimiters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
<li>You cannot change the duration of a note.</li>
<li>If you want to play notes at the same time, you will need to link multiple pianos together. Input notes, make one piano play, and electronics will handle the rest.</li>
<li>BE SURE TO LINK ALL PIANOS TOGETHER. IF YOU HAVE THREE, YOU WILL NEED TO LINK THE FIRST AND SECOND, SECOND AND THIRD, AND FIRST AND THIRD.</li>
<li>You can only enter up to 1920 notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
<li>You can use your piano's key to activate a built in factory reset.</li>
<li>You can use your piano's key to enable or disable the looping circuit.</li>
<li>You can use your piano's key to set the interval of notes from 0.1 to 0.5 seconds. The default timing is 0.5 seconds.</li>
<li>You can access your piano's internal workings by prying off the front panel.</li>
<li>You can use a multitool to reset the piano's memory once you have access to its insides.</li>
<li>You can use a multitool to link player pianos together like you would a mechcomp component.</li>
<li>If your linked pianos sound weird, you may have linked a set of pianos together multiple times. Use a multitool or key to reset and relink <i>carefully</i>.</li>
<li>You can use a wirecutter to disable looping. (WARNING, THIS IS PERMANENT, DON'T LOSE YOUR DAMN KEY)</li>
<li>You can use a screwdriver to raise and lower the wheel bolts, making the piano moveable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Automatic Player Piano Linking</h3>

<p>Use a multitool on a player piano with the cover removed.</p>
<p>Then use it on the pianos you want to link.</p>
<p>Use the multitool in your hand to start linking, each link takes 0.1 seconds.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Piano's Language</h2>

<p>Your piano will often make noises. But don't worry! It's just communicating with you. And if you can't speak piano, you have this handy little book to help.</p>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
<li>An angry sounding beep means that the piano is busy and you can't interface with it.</li>
<li>Whirring followed by a complete shutdown means that your note input was too long for the piano.</li>
<li>A lot of horrible mechanical noise followed by a complete shutdown means that the tempo you tried to input was too fast or slow.</li>
<li>Ratcheting followed by a complete shutdown means that you forgot to input a piece of a note cluster somewhere.</li>
<li>A lot of noise followed by a count of beeps means that a note you tried to play doesn't exist. The number of beeps is the position of the note.</li>
<li>If the song ends earlier than expected, make sure that you don't have any double vertical bars in your input.</li>
<li>And remember, if things are funky and not working, use your piano reset key!</li>
</ul>
