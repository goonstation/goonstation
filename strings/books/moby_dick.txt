<font face=Georgia color=black size='3'> CHAPTER 18. His Mark.<BR>
<BR>
As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, <BR>
Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their papers.<BR>
<BR>
'What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?' said I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.<BR>
<BR>
'I mean', he replied, 'he must show his papers.'<BR>
<BR>
'Yes,' said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam. 'He must show that he's converted.<BR>
Son of darkness,' he added, turning to Queequeg, 'art thou at present in communion with any Christian church?'<BR>
<BR>
'Why,' said I, 'he's a member of the first Congregational Church.' Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships atlast come to be converted into the churches.<BR>
<BR>
'First Congregational Church,' cried Bildad, 'what! that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?' and so saying, taking out<BR>
his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, <BR>
and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.<BR>
<BR>
'How long hath he been a member?' he then said, turning to me; 'not very long, I rather guess, young man.'<BR>
<BR>
'No,' said Peleg, 'and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face.'<BR>
<BR>
'Do tell, now,' cried Bildad, 'is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord's day.'<BR>
<BR>
'I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,' said I; 'all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First <BR>
Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.'<BR>
<BR>
'Young man,' said Bildad sternly, 'thou art skylarking with me'explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.'<BR>
<BR>
Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. 'I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,<BR>
and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole <BR>
worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in <i>that</i> we all join hands.' <BR>
