<h1>Mineralogy 101</h1>
<p><i>Disclaimer: At the time of writing, all information in this book is correct. However, over time, the information may become out of date.<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The distinction between minerals in a mining and/or manufacturing environment can sometimes get rather confusing.
Over the course of this handbook, we hope to give you at least a rudimentary education on the various minerals most commonly
found in a space environment, and what they should be used for. This is especially helpful if you are trying to understand
the NanoTrasen <i>"AutoArtisan"</i> standard-issue Manufacturing Units.</p>

<h2>Mauxite</h2>
<p>Classification: Sturdy Metal</p>
<p>Mauxite is a common metal alloy, characterised by its dull reddish-brown color and mild coppery smell. It is commonly used
in construction projects due to being very durable while still rather easy to work with, no doubt due to it being an alloy
comprised mostly of naturally occurring steel with elements of copper and zinc also present among other elements.
It tends to be rather easy to find in space due to its abundance, and poses little risk during extraction or refinement.</p>

<h2>Pharosium</h2>
<p>Classification: Sturdy Metal, Conductor</p>
<p>Easily recognizable due to its distinct bright orange hue, Pharosium is a conductive metal found in plentiful quantity
and as such is generally considered an industry standard. It finds most common use in electrical wiring and circuit boards.
Often, basic electronics are comprised mostly of Pharosium and Mauxite in their construction.
</p>

<h2>Molitz</h2>
<p>Classification: High Density Crystal</p>
<p>Somewhat similar to both Quartz and glass found on Earth, Molitz is a crystal formation that bears the best qualities of
both, being durable enough to withstand significant shock, and at the same time easy to work with due to its abundance and
malleability. It most often finds use in glass installations on space stations, most often affixed into place as a fine
sealant and durable enough to not pose a potential atmospheric hazard in everyday circumstances. A rare pink variant termed
<i>Molitz Beta</i> can be rarely found in deposits of regular Molitz. <i>Molitz Beta</iv> crystals contain higher oxygen content
which can be released from them upon heating, making them highly desirable combustion catalysts for combustion power systems.
</p>

<h2>Char</h2>
<p>Classification: Not Construction Grade Material</p>
<p>Char is a black, flaky substance mostly comprised of carbon, and bears a significant similarity to coal. While it is not
generally used in construction projects due to its brittle and weak structure, it does often find use as a fuel source for
basic combustion power systems. It can also be used in chemistry, as a means of acquiring large amounts of carbon and other
trace elements. The origin of this mineral is unknown, as the process of creating coal could not feasibly occur in deep space.
</p>

<h2>Cobryl</h2>
<p>Classification: Metal</p>
<p>While it rarely finds use in industrial and construction projects, Cobryl nevertheless finds itself as a notable material
due to its popularity with industries that deal in luxury. It is light blue in coloration, and when properly treated and
cleaned displays a unique lustre not seen in other materials. It has marginal strength as a metal and as such can be used in
small-scale constructions, but it should not be used for anything that requires significant sturdiness.
</p>

<h2>Cytine</h2>
<p>Classification: Crystal</p>
<p>Cytines are small gemstones of varying color. While no stronger than Molitz at best, they are prized by jewel collectors
and luxury goods traders for their compact shapes, light weight and highly varied color.
</p>

<h2>Fibrilith</h2>
<p>Classification: Crystal</p>
<p>Fibrilith is a highly strange mineral known for both its unusual threaded molecular structure and its extreme softness for
a mineral substance. While it is not paticularly useful in any kind of construction project, it has been successfully woven
into a fabric highly similar to linen. As such, it is prized by textile industries and used in clothing.
</p>

<h2>Bohrum</h2>
<p>Classification: Dense Metal, Dense Matter</p>
<p>Well known among the scientific community for its bizarre chemical makeup, Bohrum is equally well known among the
construction industry for its incredible resilience to damage. It is known to be an alloy of iron, titanium, krypton, xenon,
silver and lead, as well as several previously undiscovered chemical elements which are subject to intense research. While
the noble gases have been formed into compounds in laboratory settings, having them occur naturally with such complexity was
previously considered unthinkable. In spite of these unknown qualities, Bohrum as has yet proven to be an incredibly safe
material to work with and possesses immense strength as a construction material, though its high density makes it very heavy
and thus it is not suited to certain structural projects.
</p>

<h2>Claretine</h2>
<p>Classification: Crystal, High Energy Conductor</p>
<p>A mineral salt of a brilliant bright red coloration, Claretine is a high-end electrical conductor, able to conduct immense
amounts of electricity without suffering any damage at all. At paticularly high energy states, Pharosium and other lower
grade conductors have been known to lose efficiency due to heat and eventually break down and melt - Claretine appears to
have an incredible resistance to heat in general, and thus is spun into wire spools and used for electrical wiring in
paticularly high-energy systems. It is not common however, and should be used resourcefully.
</p>

<h2>Telecrystal</h2>
<p>Classification: Crystal, High Energy Power Source</p>
<p>With its deep purple coloration and constantly shimmering lustre, one may be prone to mistaking Telecrystal as any other
kind of gemstone - beautiful, but ultimately of little practical use. This is not the case; Telecrystal is well known among
industries and science for its extremely unusual spatial warping properties. Though it is generally not able to transmit
large amounts of matter reliably, it has seen some use in experimental (often illegal) technology, particularly by smugglers
and terrorists dealing in articles of contraband. However, despite its use as a matter transmitter and potent energy source,
Telecrystal is generally not established as a safe material, and caution should be exercised when handling and using it.
Research continues on this mineral to this day.
</p>

<h2>Miracle Matter</h2>
<p>Classification: Anomalous</p>
<p>Extremely unusual in every regard, Miracle Matter is largely considered a chameleon among minerals, well known for
arbitrarily mimicing the molecular structure and chemical composition of other minerals under highly specific conditions.
While research continues on the subject, it is suspected that subjecting Miracle Matter to a high degree of shock in the
presence of dust or regolith from other minerals will cause it to mimic the structure of whatever mineral dust first touches
it after the Miracle Matter is \"activated\", so to speak.
</p>

<h2>Uqill</h2>
<p>Classification: Extraordinarily Dense Crystalline Matter</p>
<p>Uqill is an extremely dense and heavy mineral, known for its dull jet black appearance. While extremely difficult to work
with due to its profound resilience, Uqill is generally used when large amounts of raw matter are needed in a compressed
space, such as the industry standard Dyna*Tech Rapid Construction Device (known more coloquially as \"RCD\". It also finds
use in drills and other materials that require a great deal of robustness.
</p>

<h2>Cerenkite</h2>
<p>Classification: Sturdy Metal, Conductor, Signifcant Power Source</p>
<p>Cerenkite is a light blue highly radioactive soft metal that is used as a power source in various industries. While the
dangers of mining radioactive minerals are already well known, Cerenkite poses its own particular hazard in that it is
notoriously prone to accumulating regolith (a fine mineral dust) which is easily disturbed and dispersed into the air when
the mineral is handled. As such, miners risk being exposed both externally and internally to the radiation if the proper
precautions are not taken when handling Cerenkite.
</p>

<h2>Plasmastone</h2>
<p>Classification: Crystal, Conductor, Significant Power Source</p>
<p>One of the physical naturally occurring forms of the scientifically nebulous <i>"Plasma"</i> substance that almost exclusively
powers modern space travel and industry. This is plasma in a crystalline form - care should be taken when handling it, as it
will explode if exposed to high temperatures or flames, though not to the same degree as the far more violent Erebite (which
can sometimes be found in plasmastone seams). Plasmastone of course has many of the same properties as plasma in other matter
states and such can find use as a power source for certain devices.
</p>

<h2>Viscerite</h2>
<p>Classification: Not Particularly Useful for Construction</p>
<p>Viscerite is a common material that oftentimes appears as gooey purple blobs. The theorized point of origin for the substance
is from Martian colonies, though the activities that result in the deposit of Viscerite into asteroids is not currently understood.
Thought not particularly useful in construction projects, it can be re-spun into fabric, or used as an organic material supplement
for biomatter intensive processes like cloning.
</p>

<h2>Koshmarite</h2>
<p>Classification: Crystal</p>
<p>Koshmarite is a fairly common fiber that occurs in deposits of unknown origins. It is dusted in a fine layer of regolith, as Cerenkite
is, though the pourous surface leads to less scatter of the regolith when handled. It should still be treated as a radiation hazard to
personnel working with it. It also has incredibly high albedo, leading to strong reflectance of light. Some believe that Koshmarite appears
to pulsate, though it is not known if these visual effects were conjurations brought on to the observers by acute radiation sickness.
</p>

<h2>Syreline</h2>
<p>Classification: Metal</p>
<p>Syreline is of immense value to the luxury commodity industry, being an alloy of several precious metals and having
beautiful light refracting and reflecting properties in its natural state. While it is soft and a poor choice for building
materials, the prices it commands on the mineral market more than make up for its physical weakness.
</p>

<h2>Gold</h2>
<p>Classification: Metal, Conductor, Reflective Material</p>
<p>Gold is of immense value as a raw ore that can be traded in the commodity industry. It, like Syreline, has light-refracting properties,
but is a comparatively poor conductor to some of the other mineral types one may encounter. It is not particularly useful to
construction, and primarily is desirable as a part of luxury exports from a station's shipping department.
</p>

<h2>Erebite</h2>
<p>Classification: Crystal, High Energy Conductor</p>
Erebite is an infamously dangerous and volatile mineral that has become increasingly rare in space mining as of late,
no doubt due to its propensity to violently explode if exposed to even mild amounts of heat or shock. Several high profile
industrial accidents have been caused by improper erebite handling. In spite of its hostile and deadly nature however,
erebite has unique energy-altering properties that make it invaluable as an internal power source, or as explosives.
<p>
</p>

<h2>Starstone</h2>
<p>Classification: Extraordinarily Dense Crystalline Matter</p>
<p>Starstone is a highly rare mineral not found in the vast majority of mining areas. While not paticularly useful as a
construction grade material (being only as strong as mid-grade Molitz at best), the unusual star-shaped crystal lattices
making up this jewel make the few instances of it found by astrogeologists highly prized collectors items. Sapient members
of the Rock Snake race in paticular tend to buy these for high prices, as even a small five gram crystal is able to provide
several months worth of nutrients for them.
