(*)Blob random event has been overhauled and renamed to alien invasion. Still defaults to a player-controlled blob, and there are a couple of enemy roles you can select from manually if you so desire.
(*)Player selection was improved as well and AFK blobs should a thing of the past. All eligible ghosts (didn't suicide etc) are notified by a loud sound effect and prompt, and given 2 min to acknowledge the offer, adding them to a list if they do.

(*)On your end, you will probably not notice anything (although I added some extra features to most modes for convenience)
(*)You might notice that things are broken. The basic modes should be fine, adventure might be horribly broken.
(*)Anyway, if you notice any oddities or mishaps, you know where to find me.

(*)Also, remote controls (one-state) and sliding walls.
(*)And a long-awaited feature: save and load adventure areas on the client side.

(t)fri sep 12 14

(*)Replaced the syringe gun function with large beakers instead.

(*)Adventure mode (in Build Mode) now available. This is still heavily WIP but you should find that building ad-hoc adventure areas for people has become a lot easier.
(*)Possess changed. In preparation of the new wraith mode, the new possession works differently than the old one.
(*)Mob code is hell so it is entirely possible there is some scenario where possession might cause your connection to be closed. Drop me a tell if this happens.
