Profound_Medical01@=Despite our best efforts to correct the irrational@,behaviour in our V.I.V.I-SECT-10N model,@,we haven't managed reduce it's eagerness to dissect@,any organism that it comes across, be it alive or dead.@,We are slowly running out of time with this project@,and in general it is not showing the great promise@,that we expected out of it. I think it would be much@,wiser for us to focus on D.O.C as they seem to be more@,promising, despite their unexplainable fascination with different@,body parts. Anyway, someone ought to haul V.I.V.I-SECT-10N to a@,secure storage facility until we figure out what@,do with it.
Profound_Medical02@=Fucking hell.. How am I going to explain to anyone that@,a bunch of rogue robots broke into our storage facility@,and made an escape while dragging the V.I.V.I-SECT-10N@,model with them? Nobody is going to believe that..@,Well, whatever. Good riddance, I know that I certainly@,won't miss working on that model,@, hopefully it won't cause any@,harm to anyone else, wherever it might end up.
