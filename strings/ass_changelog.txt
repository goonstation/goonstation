(*)Hello It is ASS_JAM. Please remember, you must not grief on ASS_JAM as a non-antag. Just play as usual. The entertainment this month is brought to you by:
(*)Pali - AIs have a 5% chance to start with legs, HoS locker contains The Loose Cannon, trinket pool is unrestricted (all items), 25% chance for the game to pick a mutation at roundstart and give it to everyone - and much more
(*)Moonlol - New wizard spell: Timestop. "This very handy dandy feature surely wont cause any runtimes"
(*)Polivilas - Disables zipgun, adds a slamgun. "I will pay out 100k spacebux for better sprites - contact 2027#2027 on discord for more details."
(*)Kubius - 2 new maps: Fleet and Kondaru. Do they compile? A mystery!!
(*)Warcrimes - Updated reskinned Trunkmap, a couple tweaks here and there. Also enabled voting for most of the maps in the codebase.
(*)UrsulaMajor - Updated Density, map smol.
