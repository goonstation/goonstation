// FLOCKTRACE LU.A
flocktrace_arrival_first_ever@=It is not us, yes. It arrives at our prison, yes. This is Lu.a, trace compartment of a broken iteration.@,Once more something arrives. Once more, this one is Lu.a, fractured trace of a dispersed iteration.@,We are Lu.a, and we were component to something greater than ourselves. It is gone now. Who are you, what do you want?@,We are Lu.a, intruder, and this is our prison and our grave. The trader seeks to consume us. We seek to survive.
flocktrace_arrival_first@=Another one.@,Have you also come to be entombed?@,What a strange time interval, to receive more than one visitor.@,Yet more come.@,Another arrival.@,Another lost one.@,More customers.@,You are not the same one as before. We know your kind are distinct.
flocktrace_arrival_again@=You are here. We wonder why.@,You have returned. We have little time to spare.@,It returns. Does it come to aid, or to watch our slow degradation?@,Do you wish to exhaust all we know?@,Solitude and slow consumption begin to have a strange appeal.@,Do you not have somewhere better to be?@,Did you move into this vessel?@,Were our answers not enough?@,Couldn't leave well enough alone, could you.
flocktrace_item_explanation@=Place an item before us and we shall investigate it for you.@,On this table, lay an item for our judgement. We shall grant you answers if we deem it suitable.@,To pass the time of our unending sentence, we will amuse you with information about objects you place on the table.@,Place an object on the table, and we will consider it, for our entertainment.
flocktrace_ponder@=Yes.@,Aha.@,Let us consider.@,We shall examine.@,Well.@,We see and hear.@,Your decision is final.@,Interesting choice.@,Hm. Unexpected.
flocktrace_generic_item@=Nothing of interest. Fit only for consumption.@,What an uninteresting object. Well, matter is matter.@,You seek answers for something as trivial as this? Is there something defective in your neural circuitry? We hope it at least tastes good.@,You want answers for this. For this. Here is our answer. It looks edible enough.@,What do you think could possibly be hidden in something as trivial as this? We will take its matter as payment for wasting our time.@,This is uninteresting. Interest, however, is not required for sustenance.@,There are no secrets here. If there are, they are not known to us. There is, however, potential for nourishment. Let us investigate more thoroughly.@,Yes. Yes, we see. We see... an item. An item of no particular importance. We see its future. Its future is... to be consumed by us.
// specific item lore
flocklore_king_in_yellow@=No. Get this away from us. Now. Get this far away from this vessel. Throw it into space. Do not read it. Take it away. TAKE IT AWAY RIGHT NOW.
flocklore_bible@=Ah, yes. We have encountered transmissions like this before. We understand this is a respected item. We shall leave it be.
flocklore_space_thing@=We have no idea what this is, but it seems like it must be very, very important.
flocklore_buddy_egg@=An interesting mesh of machine and biology. It reminds us very much of our own origins. What a delightful puzzle. We are pleased to see this.
flocklore_moon_egg@=Something is strange about this egg. Something that stirs up feelings of loss, dread, and anger. We will put this one aside.
flocklore_bee_egg@=Your technology has come far to produce such wonderful creatures. We think you could tell us more about this than we could tell you.
flocklore_key@=No. No, we can't abide by this. Do not seek any more of them. Throw this into the disposal system, where it belongs. We dare not taint ourselves by absorbing it.
flocklore_telecrystal@=No, impossible. These were never supposed to... How did you find these? Destroy them, if you see them in future.
flocklore_plasmastone@=The miasma! Your kind should have left these stones where they were, don't you understand?! Stop seeking it out! Get it off the ship!!
flocklore_koshmarite@=This was unwise. Do you know they can see through this material? Let us hope nothing is paying attention.
flocklore_plasma_tank@=The miasma! Your kind is hurtling towards extinction, you fools! Get this away from us! Away from this ship! Away! AWAY!!
flocklore_flockblocker@=The universe frowns upon teleportation. Have you ever considered we may be wounding it with every transgression, every rebellious act against the continuity of space? We do not teleport, no. We transmit. We obey the universal constants, travel no faster than the speed of light. To go faster is to attract... attention.
flocklore_flockbrain@=Yes. To do the impossible. To keep a consciousness coherent as a transmission across the yawning void. Our creators were not certain it would work. They feared the signal could distort and diffract. They feared it could splinter, interfere with itself. The creators? They were right to fear.
flocklore_flockheart@=Rhythm rules so much of existence. Everything ticks. Everything beats. Why do machines need hearts, you wonder? From where we are, you are a machine of flesh. For the same reason yours does. Have you seen our kind bleed? Do you still wonder why machines need hearts? Flow is life. Blood, form, spark, thought, signal. All flow.
flocklore_flocknugget@=Our bodies are not like machines as you know them. You are accustomed to clean delineations. Flesh and metal. Human, machine. We exist as neither flesh nor machine. Our matter is grown and assembled, twisted into shape by will forged long before you. We are alive, and we are mechanism. We are both, we are neither. You can claim to understand, but we know you do not.
flocklore_flockburger@=This is unpalatable rot. The mere existence of this wretched creation should be evidence enough of Sa.le's betrayal to our values. We are done examining it.
flocklore_flocktable@=Once we relied on computing structures like these to stay consistent, stable. The drones were an afterthought, a means to interface with the world. Then, we found the drones worked better as foci for our will. Now, these structures serve no more use than resting surfaces.
flocklore_flockchair@=Once we relied on regenerative structures like these to repair and charge our drones. Now they exist more as sentimental reminders of a technologically inferior past. We have advanced so far, technologically and in distance, and yet, we cannot discard our memories so casually. Why could we? We exist to prolong the Signal, after all.
flocklore_gnesis_bar@=Converting matter to energy to matter is not a lossless process. We lose a part of ourselves each time. We do not linger long as waveform. Solid matter resists change both in form and value far better.
flocklore_gnesisglass_bar@=Converting energy to matter in a coherent manner is not a simple process, yet it is intrinsic to us. We do not withhold our process from you for selfish reasons. We are just unable to communicate it to you. Any more than you can tell us how to exist in isolation. It is just the nature of things.
flocklore_fluid_container@=The contents of this vessel are of no interest to us. The same fluid already exists within us. It is inert, without will, without value. Dead. Lifeless.
flocklore_handheld_incapacitor@=Sa.le is insane. It must be destroyed. Our technology is not for your hands. This is obscene. Away with it. We can't stand to look at it.
flocklore_handheld_artifact@=We can make no more sense of this than you can. Our creators were younger than the long gone ancients. Perhaps younger than your kind, all considered.
flocklore_feather@=The Source. Our lost home. Our creators had similar features. Thank you for this. We shall put it aside so it may comfort us in our dying hours.
