They'll look a bit different, but also take some load off of our lighting system. Affects PDA lights, station bots, and human burning status right now.

(*)Job preferences window is slightly better! Slightly! Hopefully! Report issues as usual, please.
(*)Windows that don't have chui enabled will now look less like 1999 default websites.

(*)Added an AND/OR toggle to the access-pro if you use it in-hand when its empty. This lets you specify if you want a door to require a list of accesses for entry, or allow anyone who meets any one value in the list.
(*)If a door has 0 access requirements, it can be deconstructed with the deconstruction device now.

(*)Deconstruction Device will appear in engineer lockers as well as mechanic lockers.
(*)The Deconstruction Device can now be used to deconstruct more kinds of objects, and not just things mechanics have created (either click in-hand or use mousedrag). When you deconstruct an object, it turns into a mechanics frame that can later be soldered up at a different location. Most things will require some tool use to deconstruct as well, depending on complexity of the object.
(*)There will probably be some bugs or objects I've forgotten to whitelist as 'deconstructable'. Please report if you encounter those!

(*)Moved hold-at-gunpoint functions to the new item grabs framework. Hold any gun and click someone on Grab intent to hold them hostage. This behaves similar to the old gunpoint mode, but now it's more flexible and you can get a tight hold + pull the target around.
(*)Fixed bullets that throw the impacted player, like shotgun rounds - they were throwing in basically random directions instead of the direction the bullet was moving and weren't throwing at all on pointblank shots. Also, players who are thrown through the air by bullets will no longer be able to counteract the throw by running (this behavior is unchanged for normal throws)

(*)Basically, you can target items to turn them into snakes. If you target people, you can turn whatever they have in their active hand into a snake. If you use your staff, the resulting snakes will be aggressive. If you don't, they'll only act in self defense. Killing the snakes reverts them back to the original item!
(*)There are a couple special snakes from casting your spell on specific items. Collect them all (set up a zoo)!

(*)The radio show host now spawns with a sleeve of exclusive radio station records. Thanks again to Urs for helping curate this collection. Also, now, most records should have some basic identifying descriptions so you can keep track of your favorites.
(*)Thanks to Phuzzy, we now have a new radio station advertisement tape, featuring Discount Dan's Quik Noodles. It's very good. Find it (and its friends) in the radio station's trash can.
(*)Added the grapefruit grape mutation patch by UrsulaMajor and LovelyMimic! You can cut grapefruits into wedges and garnish drinks with them. Also, having grapefruit juice in your system makes medical chems deplete quicker!
(u)mbc
(*)You can now pin someone by grabbing them and clicking the floor. The action will happen faster if you have a tight grip before starting. Neither party will be able to move during the pin (but the target can resist), and the pin will break when the attacker's stamina runs out.

(*)You can stamp them with various stamps. It makes them look different, too.
(*)They're now actual stickers that you can stick to things. You can also write on them while they're stuck to things.

(*)Syndicate assault trooper rifle now has single and burst firing modes. The former functions as the gun has all this time. The latter fires a burst of projectiles that each do less damage and have lower effective range, sacrificing precision and ammo efficiency for close-range stopping power.
(*)Made very minor changes in gun-related code. It has been tested extensively but if something were to start to break for whatever reason regardless, please post a bug report and/or scream at me.
(u)mbc
(*)Reworked the way stun reductions work. (They used to reduce all stuns by some amount per life tick. Now, stuns are reduced on the instant of application by some percentage value). This affects lots of drugs, but also fixes some stuff like the changeling abomination form.
(*)Disorient reductions have been introduced as properties of armor. Currently the only things that grant a disorient reduction are the security barrier, heavy riot suit, and EOD armor. Probably make some craftable civilian version at some point.
(*)You can view these protection values by using the STAT tooltip on the ingame HUD.
(*)Fixed a longstanding bug where you could get the benefits of armor simply by holding it in your hand (no more spacewalking by holding a space suit, sorry)
(u)Gannets
(*)Slight amendments to some Nuckear Operative classes:

(*)"Maturation Rate" and "Production Rate" have been changed to be in line with the other stats - positive is good, negative bad. Effects that changed them one way or the other have been updated accordingly.
(*)The botanical mister now has a "high power" mode where it outputs more reagents to plant pots at once. It can also be examined for a hint about what's inside.

(*)Chair flip is now a targeted ability where you can click on a tile to throw yourself in that direction. Flipping will launch you in whatever direction your character is facing.
(*)Chair flip range extended to 3 tiles instead of 2. You will deal more damage to targets who are farther away. Missing your target (slamming into walls etc) can hurt a little.

(*)Made some changes to how ability HUDs are shown. They now show the points required to use them and the cooldown until they're usable. If you don't have enough points, the number turns red and the icon goes dim until you do.
(*)This might break a bunch of stuff or cause tons of lag. I tested as much as I could, so hopefully it doesn't.
(*)This doesn't apply to blobs which have their own ablity HUD...

(*)New year, new things. The radio station has finally refreshed its brain numbing, headache inducing repertoire of repetition. Instead of being stowed away inside the wooden desks, these records are now found in two very lovely record sleeves on top of the desks (well, now, tables).
(*)A big thanks to everyone who participated in the November monthly contest and submitted their art for record sleeves! This includes: Pali, Sartorius, Valterak, Wisecrack34, Tewf, Crazyabe, Schwicky_Schwag, Bologna Prime, Monolithburger, saccharinChampion, Studenterhue, and Flaborized!
(*)And another big thanks to UrsulaMajor for curating the new selection of music!

(*)Some more AI changes:
(*)AI cores now have 250 HP instead of 100.
(*)AI cores will die at 0 HP, instead of going into a sort of timed "crit" state. In practice this mostly just means that if your HP is below 0, you won't suddenly die five minutes later, you'll die now.
(*)Power is also a little different. Hitting 0 charge will kill an AI. However, if the AI core starts charging and reaches 100 charge, it will turn back on (assuming it hasn't been otherwise damaged beyond operating).
(*)Reviving an AI can be done by clicking on it at any time while it's dead, not just while it's fully assembled.

(*)Slight update to wraith. Now they have a visible health bar at the top right of the screen.
(*)Wraith has a new ability "poltergeist". The old "poltergeist" ability is now called "spook", and the new one creates a portal that tries to summon a poltergeist from a pool of eligible dead players.
(*)Poltergeists get several of the weaker wraith abilities and must stay within a certain distance of their portal or thier master.

(*)AI announcements now also make a sound like the regular announcement computers!
(*)Fixed (hopefully) all of the lingering bee honey bugs!
(*)Bees spawned from eggs weren't having proper maximum reagent volume set, often making them unable to produce honey, particularly in the case of queen bees, which spawn unique big blobs of honey. That has been fixed.
(*)Honey would pre-spawn with some honey already in it, causing there to be less room for the bee's reagents, meaning that usually produced honey would not have all of the bee's reagents in it. This has also been rectified. This also means that from now on if your bee feeds on for example a cannabis plant, you can be certain that the reagents of the mentioned will carry over to the honey's reagents.
(*)Fixed merchant shuttles not cleaning up after themselves while leaving, resulting in a bunch of shuttle floor remaining where they landed. Also meddled with certain chairs' rotations to remove any instances of them hiding beneath those.

(*)AIs have a HUD now! It shows the AI core's health, charge, and tracking info, as well as buttons to open the APC for the area your eye is under and to change your status/color.
(*)Cyborgs and the AI, when killswitched, will eject their brains instead of spontaneously gibbing.
(*)When a cyborg's head is destroyed, the brain is dropped onto the ground.
(*)AI shells now take on the name of the AI while the AI is using it. It will reset back to the default afterwards.
(*)AI is a high-priority role again. Basically, the game will try to add an AI to every round. This will allow people who have it on medium or low to get assigned to it instead of a round starting with no AI at all. (AI defaults to Unwanted in your job preferences.)
(*)As usual, please report any issues.

(*)PlantMaster spliced seeds now merge the names of the seeds as "Xxxyyy" rather than making "Hybrid Xxxxxx".

(*)The UV lamp also actually acts like a lamp.

(*)Features of the Marksman's rifle include: 4 shot capacity, back-slot carriable, high damage, stun and knockback on hit.
(*)Holding the SPRINT key enters your rifle scope's zoom mode. (Shift on default controls, space on tg layout)
(*)From here you can use the WASD keys to move your view to hit targets at a range further than your usual vision permits.

(*)Mechanically, this means that each station's mining shuttle now leads directly to the center of the mining z-level, making it easier than ever to exploit the ressources there. John Bill has added a new stop to his bus, now transiting between the old mining station on z3, and the diner on z5.
(*)Old Mining Station is also seeing some renovations- access restrictions have been relaxed, free internals and fresh air tanks are available, as well as a transport chute to and from John's new shuttle dock. Check it out!

(*)Any flash can convert for the purposes of the revolution. Default flashes will still do the conversion SFX, but I quieted the flash sound a bit.
(*)Correction to the previous message : The Spooky bug only affected new smoke. Old smoke was intended to use these higher amounts. I believe it's all been sorted out now?
(*)Fixed a spooky bug where TOUCH application amounts recieved from smoke (both old and new, I believe) were way off proportion and much higher than they should be. (NOTE : If this changes any reagents that depended on the bug to function properly in smoke, let me know on discord or forums)
(*)Changed the effect of a critical hit on stamina. The previous behavior was to always set the target's stamina to 1 if they were above, and KO if they were below. The new behavior is to apply a multiplier to the stamina damage of the attack, diceroll for stun when below or at 0.
