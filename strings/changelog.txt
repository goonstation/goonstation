(*)Fixed bullets that throw the impacted player, like shotgun rounds - they were throwing in basically random directions instead of the direction the bullet was moving and weren't throwing at all on pointblank shots.

If you use your staff, the resulting snakes will be aggressive. If you don't, they'll only act in self defense. Killing the snakes reverts them back to the original item!
(*)There are a couple special snakes from casting your spell on specific items. Collect them all (set up a zoo)!

(*)More things can be vaccinated. The Synth-o-Matic might also be more useful in making cures? idk. Also, oxygen farts.

(*)Sticky notes no longer show up completely black when written on. Thanks to AwkwardDryad for the initial patch. They were also more or less entirely re-coded. Welp.
(*)Writing on them will update their appearance. Messages with ! and ? will show a ! or ? on the note instead.
(*)You can stamp them with various stamps. It makes them look different, too.
(*)They're now actual stickers that you can stick to things. You can also write on them while they're stuck to things.
(*)Help intent will peel a sticky note off of whatever it's stuck to.
(*)Old sticky notes still exist in some places, for now. As a temporary measure, a box of sticky notes will accompany any natural stack of sticky notes.

(*)Implemented party crab patch (code by UrsulaMajor, sprites by Aleks)

(*)The Cyborg jumper cables thing may be slightly less obtuse in its use now. Hopefully.

(*)Use Grab intent with a cloth (material piece) to hold someone aggressively with an additional effect of muffled speech. Not a 'quiet' effect, it's normal volume and more unintelligible.

(*)You can now suplex two people at once.
(*)Slightly changed suplex stun times.

(*)Syndicate assault trooper rifle now has single and burst firing modes. The former functions as the gun has all this time. The latter fires a burst of projectiles that each do less damage and have lower effective range, sacrificing precision and ammo efficiency for close-range stopping power.
(*)Made very minor changes in gun-related code. It has been tested extensively but if something were to start to break for whatever reason regardless, please post a bug report and/or scream at me.
(u)mbc
(*)Reworked the way stun reductions work. (They used to reduce all stuns by some amount per life tick. Now, stuns are reduced on the instant of application by some percentage value). This affects lots of drugs, but also fixes some stuff like the changeling abomination form.
(*)Disorient reductions have been introduced as properties of armor. Currently the only things that grant a disorient reduction are the security barrier, heavy riot suit, and EOD armor. Probably make some craftable civilian version at some point.
(*)You can view these protection values by using the STAT tooltip on the ingame HUD.
(*)Fixed a longstanding bug where you could get the benefits of armor simply by holding it in your hand (no more spacewalking by holding a space suit, sorry)
(u)Gannets
(*)Slight amendments to some Nuckear Operative classes:
(*)Assault Trooper's rifle now fires the 3-round burst you always thought it did.

(*)The plant analyzer has a new readout that includes a nifty graph. Green good, red bad.
(*)"Maturation Rate" and "Production Rate" have been changed to be in line with the other stats - positive is good, negative bad. Effects that changed them one way or the other have been updated accordingly.
(*)The botanical mister now has a "high power" mode where it outputs more reagents to plant pots at once. It can also be examined for a hint about what's inside.

(*)Chair flip is now a targeted ability where you can click on a tile to throw yourself in that direction. Flipping will launch you in whatever direction your character is facing.
(*)Chair flip range extended to 3 tiles instead of 2. You will deal more damage to targets who are farther away. Missing your target (slamming into walls etc) can hurt a little.

(*)Along with this we now have ten new secret chems for you to find
(*)Disguiseium, Crime, Stable/Unstable Omega Hairgrownium, Medusa, Directed Nanites, Juggernaut, Deep Fried Dabs, Warp, and Sheltergrog!
(*)Details will be on the wiki shortly

(*)You can now staple masks to people's faces. Just have them on an operating table, and target their head while on help intent. Highly recommended for devout clowns and mimes.
(*)Trying to remove someone's stapled mask will give them some noninsignificant brute damage (much like with stapled butts) and stun them for 4 seconds. This should hopefully prevent nerds from abusing this, but let me know if that still proves an issue.
(u)Zamujasa
(*)Made some changes to how ability HUDs are shown. They now show the points required to use them and the cooldown until they're usable. If you don't have enough points, the number turns red and the icon goes dim until you do.
(*)This might break a bunch of stuff or cause tons of lag. I tested as much as I could, so hopefully it doesn't.
(*)This doesn't apply to blobs which have their own ablity HUD...

(*)New year, new things. The radio station has finally refreshed its brain numbing, headache inducing repertoire of repetition. Instead of being stowed away inside the wooden desks, these records are now found in two very lovely record sleeves on top of the desks (well, now, tables).
(*)A big thanks to everyone who participated in the November monthly contest and submitted their art for record sleeves! This includes: Pali, Sartorius, Valterak, Wisecrack34, Tewf, Crazyabe, Schwicky_Schwag, Bologna Prime, Monolithburger, saccharinChampion, Studenterhue, and Flaborized!
(*)And another big thanks to UrsulaMajor for curating the new selection of music!
(u)Zamujasa
(*)Some more AI changes:
(*)AI cores now have 250 HP instead of 100.
(*)AI cores will die at 0 HP, instead of going into a sort of timed "crit" state. In practice this mostly just means that if your HP is below 0, you won't suddenly die five minutes later, you'll die now.
(*)Power is also a little different. Hitting 0 charge will kill an AI. However, if the AI core starts charging and reaches 100 charge, it will turn back on (assuming it hasn't been otherwise damaged beyond operating).
(*)Reviving an AI can be done by clicking on it at any time while it's dead, not just while it's fully assembled.

(*)Pods can brake (hold your SPRINT button)
(*)Pods bump into things and take/deal damage just like subs do.
(*)When impacted by a taser, there is a chance that the pod's wormhole recharge will be put on cooldown.
(u)Kyle
(*)Slight update to wraith. Now they have a visible health bar at the top right of the screen.
(*)Wraith has a new ability "poltergeist". The old "poltergeist" ability is now called "spook", and the new one creates a portal that tries to summon a poltergeist from a pool of eligible dead players.
(*)Poltergeists get several of the weaker wraith abilities and must stay within a certain distance of their portal or thier master.

(*)AI announcements now also make a sound like the regular announcement computers!
(*)Fixed (hopefully) all of the lingering bee honey bugs!
(*)Bees spawned from eggs weren't having proper maximum reagent volume set, often making them unable to produce honey, particularly in the case of queen bees, which spawn unique big blobs of honey. That has been fixed.
(*)Honey would pre-spawn with some honey already in it, causing there to be less room for the bee's reagents, meaning that usually produced honey would not have all of the bee's reagents in it. This has also been rectified. This also means that from now on if your bee feeds on for example a cannabis plant, you can be certain that the reagents of the mentioned will carry over to the honey's reagents.
(*)Fixed merchant shuttles not cleaning up after themselves while leaving, resulting in a bunch of shuttle floor remaining where they landed. Also meddled with certain chairs' rotations to remove any instances of them hiding beneath those.

(*)We managed to have a changelog entry every day this month. Neat.
(*)AI QOL: As AI, "Y" gives you the radio channel popup, so you can pick from all your radio channels.
(*)AIs have a HUD now! It shows the AI core's health, charge, and tracking info, as well as buttons to open the APC for the area your eye is under and to change your status/color.
(*)Cyborgs and the AI, when killswitched, will eject their brains instead of spontaneously gibbing.
(*)When a cyborg's head is destroyed, the brain is dropped onto the ground.
(*)AI shells now take on the name of the AI while the AI is using it. It will reset back to the default afterwards.
(*)AI is a high-priority role again. Basically, the game will try to add an AI to every round. This will allow people who have it on medium or low to get assigned to it instead of a round starting with no AI at all. (AI defaults to Unwanted in your job preferences.)
(*)As usual, please report any issues.

(*)Thanks to Urs for this exciting new feature & thanks to Schwick for the new sprites!
(u)Zamujasa
(*)PlantMaster spliced seeds now merge the names of the seeds as "Xxxyyy" rather than making "Hybrid Xxxxxx".
(*)Botany's UV lamp and mister have a range of 2 instead of 1, so you don't have to keep them directly next to plants.
(*)The UV lamp also actually acts like a lamp.
(*)Produce grown in botany will have names based on splices and mutations. Sometimes it might carry over to things made with them, who knows! This almost certainly broke something esoteric I didn't find so please report any bugs.

(*)Fixed a spooky bug where TOUCH application amounts recieved from smoke (both old and new, I believe) were way off proportion and much higher than they should be. (NOTE : If this changes any reagents that depended on the bug to function properly in smoke, let me know on discord or forums)
(*)Changed the effect of a critical hit on stamina. The previous behavior was to always set the target's stamina to 1 if they were above, and KO if they were below. The new behavior is to apply a multiplier to the stamina damage of the attack, diceroll for stun when below or at 0.
(*)Add Propellant reagent recipe from Sayuta (replicates old smoke behavior). Mix Chlorine, Platinum, Hydrogen, Sugar, Stabilizing Agent.
