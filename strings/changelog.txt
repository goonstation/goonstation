(*)Added a new map, the Nadir Extraction Site. Located on the caustic planet of Magus, Nadir is nestled deep within an acid sea to escape the corrosive sleetstorms that ravage its surface.
(*)The Site was constructed over a vast deposit of Miraclium, and its unique circumstances necessitate prototype machinery; extract and transmute Miraclium with the cutting-edge Harmonic Siphon, harness the acid's unique properties for power with catalytic generators, and "safely" transport goods on- and off-site with the Transception Array.
(*)Thank you to the community testers who tried the map in early test sessions, and the devs who adopted it for the iteration to come. This was kind of a wacky idea, and I'm amazed that it has come to fruition.
