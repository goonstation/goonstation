(*)Replaces the AI upload computer with a rack of law modules. These law modules are physical objects each containing a law, which can be removed, rearranged, and added to the law rack to change the AI's laws.
(*)Multiple Law Racks can exist, and be connected to different AIs and borgs, giving them different law sets.
(*)If the original law rack is destroyed, building a new one will reconnect all non-emagged borgs to the new one.
(+)The roboticists get a new tool called the Linker to connect cyborgs to law racks, if they've lost their existing connection.
(+)Roboticists can now print off new law sets, in case something happens to the original Asimov laws.
(+)Cyborgs and AIs can examine one another to see if they are following the same law set.
(+)Using the linker tool on a connected borg will tell the user where the rack they are connected to is.
(+)Ion storms cause law modules to malfunction, and they must be ejected from the law rack and reset before the module will return to normal.

(*)Nuclear Operative Commanders now have a specialized uplink! More info in Minor Changes. Nuclear bomb remote has been moved to the uplink.
(+)The commander's uplink uses "points" versus the traditional TC, and gains 1 point for every 20 people online (minimum of 2 points)
(+)The uplink has 6 items, being the Nuclear bomb teleporter, reinforcement beacon, ammo bag, specialist ammo bag, laser designator, and rapid deployment remote, the new ones described in further changelog entries.
(+)First is a reinforcement beacon for 2 points to summon a syndicate gunbot to assist the nuclear team.
(+)Second is the Ammo Bag and its specialist version (2/3 points, respectively), which both allow the nuclear operatives to fabricate more ammunition for their guns.
(+)Third is the laser designator for 3 points, which allows the commander to call in two high-explosive airstrikes from the Cairngorm to hit anywhere they designate!
(+)Finally is the Rapid Deployment Remote, costing a whole 4 points, which allows the commander to send the nuclear team in through drop pods onto anywhere on station!
