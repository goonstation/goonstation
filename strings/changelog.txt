(*)Portable flashers now flash for bigger critters. Be careful of sprinting your antag critter respawn into security.

(+)You can now obtain changeling meat by either butchering changeling critters (buttcrabs, legworms, etc) or tossing a changeling in the gibber. This meat can either be cooked into a steak, or cooked with dough for an aburgination, which is very unsafe to eat. Otherwise, it's like mystery meat.
