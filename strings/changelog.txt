(+)The uplink has 6 items, being the Nuclear bomb teleporter, reinforcement beacon, ammo bag, specialist ammo bag, laser designator, and rapid deployment remote, the new ones described in further changelog entries.
(+)First is a reinforcement beacon for 2 points to summon a syndicate gunbot to assist the nuclear team.
(+)Second is the Ammo Bag and its specialist version (2/3 points, respectively), which both allow the nuclear operatives to fabricate more ammunition for their guns.
(+)Third is the laser designator for 3 points, which allows the commander to call in two high-explosive airstrikes from the Cairngorm to hit anywhere they designate!
(+)Finally is the Rapid Deployment Remote, costing a whole 4 points, which allows the commander to send the nuclear team in through drop pods onto anywhere on station!
