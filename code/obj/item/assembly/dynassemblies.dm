//okay this might be shit but it works okay, feel free to un-shit it

//Let's start with the basics.
//To create a dynamic assembly, you create the dynassembly object by calling an attackby on your starting item, then running newpart with 1st arg being src
//Then, the 2nd arg is the part you are attacking with or adding. Finally, you set firstrun to true because well its the 1st run.
//To add stuff to a dynamic assembly, you hit it with another obj in validparts. See: attackby
//If you are not happy with your in progress assembly, wrench it.
//If you are happy and you have a valid combo, screwdriver it to create your product.
