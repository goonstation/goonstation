	Congratulations, your station has purchased the H-87 industrial cloning device!<br>
	Using the H-87 is almost as simple as brain surgery! Simply insert the target humanoid into the scanning chamber and select the scan option to create a new profile!<br>
	<b>That's all there is to it!</b><br>
	<i>Notice, cloning system cannot scan inorganic life or small primates.  Scan may fail if subject has suffered extreme brain damage.</i><br>
	<p>Clone profiles may be viewed through the profiles menu. Scanning implants a complementary HEALTH MONITOR IMPLANT into the subject, which may be viewed from the cloning console.
	Profile Deletion has been restricted to \[Station Head\] level access.</p>
	<h4>Cloning from a profile</h4>
	Cloning is as simple as pressing the CLONE option to the right of the desired profile.<br>
	Per your company's EMPLOYEE PRIVACY RIGHTS agreement, the H-87 has been blocked from cloning crewmembers while they are still alive.<br>
	<br>
	<p>The provided CLONEPOD SYSTEM will produce the desired clone.  Standard clone maturation times (With SPEEDCLONE technology) are roughly 90 seconds.
	The cloning pod may be unlocked early with any \[Medical Researcher\] ID after initial maturation is complete.</p><br>
	<i>Please note that resulting clones may have a small DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECT as a result of genetic drift.</i><br>
	<h4>Profile Management</h4>
	<p>The H-87 (as well as your station's standard genetics machine) can accept STANDARD DATA DISKETTES.
	These diskettes are used to transfer genetic information between machines and profiles.
	A load/save dialog will become available in each profile if a disk is inserted.</p><br>
	<i>A good diskette is a great way to counter aforementioned genetic drift!</i><br>

	<h4>Setting Up the Cryogenics Chambers</h4>
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Secure a filled canister of O2 or another suitable air mixture to the attached connector using a wrench.</li>
	<li>Add a 50-unit supply of cryoxadone to each of the two cryogenics chambers. There should be two nearby beakers for this purpose; if they are missing or empty, it is recommended that a request be sent to the research department to synthesize an additional supply.</li>
	<li>Set the freezer to the lowest possible temperature setting (73.15 K, the default) if necessary.</li>
	<li>Turn on the power on the freezer and leave it on.</li>
	<li>One can add a defibrillator to attempt to revive subjects as well.</li>
	</ol>
	Note that the supply of cryoxadone will not deplete unless there is a patient present in the cryogenics chamber. However, the oxygen slowly depletes if the cryogenics chambers themselves are turned on, so it is recommended to leave them switched off unless a patient is present.<br><br>
	<h4>Treating a Patient Using the Cryogenics Chambers</h4>
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Stabilize the patient's health using CPR or cardiac stimulants.</li>
	<li>Remove any exosuit, headgear, and any other insulative materials being worn by the patient. Failure to remove these will deter the effects of the cryoxadone and halt the healing process.</li>
	<li>Check to ensure that the gas temperature is at optimal levels and there is no contamination in the system.</li>
	<li>Put the patient in the cryogenics chamber and turn it on.</li>
	</ol>
	The cryogenics chamber will automatically eject patients once their health is back to normal, but post-cryo evaluation is recommended nevertheless.

Security must then execute said warrant.<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Pre-Pre-Trial Phase:</B><BR>\nNow a legal representative must be presented to the defendant if said defendant requests one. That person and the defendant are then to be given time to meet (in the jail IS ACCEPTABLE). The defendant and his lawyer are then to be given a copy of all the evidence that will be presented at trial (rewriting it all on paper is fine). THIS IS CALLED THE DISCOVERY PACK. With a few exceptions, THIS IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE BOTH SIDES MAY USE AT TRIAL. IF the prosecution will be seeking the death penalty it MUST be stated at this time. ALSO if the defense will be seeking not guilty by mental defect it must state this at this time to allow ample time for examination.<BR>\nNow at this time each side is to compile a list of witnesses. By default, the defendant is on both lists regardless of anything else. Also the defense and prosecution can compile more evidence beforehand BUT in order for it to be used the evidence MUST also be given to the other side.\nThe defense has time to compile motions against some evidence here.<BR>\n<B>Possible Motions:</B><BR>\n1. <U>Invalidate Evidence-</U> Something with the evidence is wrong and the evidence is to be thrown out. This includes irrelevance or corrupt security.<BR>\n2. <U>Free Movement-</U> Basically the defendant is to be kept uncuffed before and during the trial.<BR>\n3. <U>Subpoena Witness-</U> If the defense presents god reasons for needing a witness but said person fails to cooperate then a subpoena is issued.<BR>\n4. <U>Drop the Charges-</U> Not enough evidence is there for a trial so the charges are to be dropped. The FT CAN RETRY but the judicial authority must carefully reexamine the new evidence.<BR>\n5. <U>Declare Incompetent-</U> Basically the defendant is insane. Once this is granted a medical official is to examine the patient. If he is indeed insane he is to be placed under care of the medical staff until he is deemed competent to stand trial.<BR>\n<BR>\nALL SIDES MOVE TO A COURTROOM<BR>\n<B>Pre-Trial Hearings:</B><BR>\nA judicial authority and the 2 sides are to meet in the trial room. NO ONE ELSE BESIDES A SECURITY DETAIL IS TO BE PRESENT. The defense submits a plea. If the plea is guilty then proceed directly to sentencing phase. Now the sides each present their motions to the judicial authority. He rules on them. Each side can debate each motion. Then the judicial authority gets a list of crew members. He first gets a chance to look at them all and pick out acceptable and available jurors. Those jurors are then called over. Each side can ask a few questions and dismiss jurors they find too biased. HOWEVER before dismissal the judicial authority MUST agree to the reasoning.<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>The Trial:</B><BR>\nThe trial has three phases.<BR>\n1. <B>Opening Arguments</B>- Each side can give a short speech. They may not present ANY evidence.<BR>\n2. <B>Witness Calling/Evidence Presentation</B>- The prosecution goes first and is able to call the witnesses on his approved list in any order. He can recall them if necessary. During the questioning the lawyer may use the evidence in the questions to help prove a point. After every witness the other side has a chance to cross-examine. After both sides are done questioning a witness the prosecution can present another or recall one (even the EXACT same one again!). After prosecution is done the defense can call witnesses. After the initial cases are presented both sides are free to call witnesses on either list.<BR>\nFINALLY once both sides are done calling witnesses we move onto the next phase.<BR>\n3. <B>Closing Arguments</B>- Same as opening.<BR>\nThe jury then deliberates IN PRIVATE. THEY MUST ALL AGREE on a verdict. REMEMBER: They mix between some charges being guilty and others not guilty (IE if you supposedly killed someone with a gun and you unfortunately picked up a gun without authorization then you CAN be found not guilty of murder BUT guilty of possession of illegal weaponry.). Once they have agreed they present their verdict. If unable to reach a verdict and feel they will never they call a deadlocked jury and we restart at Pre-Trial phase with an entirely new set of jurors.<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Sentencing Phase:</B><BR>\nIf the death penalty was sought (you MUST have gone through a trial for death penalty) then skip to the second part. <BR>\nI. Each side can present more evidence/witnesses in any order. There is NO ban on emotional aspects or anything. The prosecution is to submit a suggested penalty. After all the sides are done then the judicial authority is to give a sentence.<BR>\nII. The jury stays and does the same thing as I. Their sole job is to determine if the death penalty is applicable. If NOT then the judge selects a sentence.<BR>\n<BR>\nTADA you're done. Security then executes the sentence and adds the applicable convictions to the person's record.<BR>\n"

Standard checklist for thermo-electric generator cold-start:
<HR>
<ol>
<li>Perform visual inspection of the <b>HOT (left)</b> and <b>COLD (right)</b> coolant-exchange pipe loops. Weld any breaks or cracks in the pipes before continuing.
<li>Connect one Plasma canister to a cooling loop supply port with a wrench, and open the adjacent supply valve.
<li>Connect one Plasma canister to a heating loop supply port with a wrench, and open the adjacent supply valve.<BR>
<i>Note:</i> Observe standard canister safety procedures. Additional canisters may be utilized or mixed together for various thermodynamic effects. CO2 and N2 can be effective moderators.
<li>Open the main gas supply valves on both loops, the core inlet and outlet valves on both loops, and the combustion chamber bypass valve on the hot loop.<BR>
<i>If you wish to use the supplemental combustion chamber instead of or in addition to the furnaces, close the bypass and open the inlet and outlet valves above it.</i><BR>
<li>Coolant supply and exchange pump settings can be adjusted from the Control Room.<BR>
<li>Load the furnaces with char ore and activate them. Reload as needed. Plasmastone and various other materials may be used as well.
<li>Heat can be provided by the furnaces, the gas combustion chamber, or in experimental setups, direct combustion of pipe coolant*.<BR>
<b>*Direct combustion of internal coolant may void your engine warranty and result in: fire, explosion, death, and/or property damage.</b><BR>
<li>In the event of hazardous coolant pressure buildup, use the vent valves in maintenance above the engine core to drain line pressure. If the engine is not functioning properly, check your line pressure.
<li>Generator efficiency may suffer if the pressure differential between loops becomes too high. This may be rectified by adding more gas pressure to the low side or draining the high side.
<li>The circulator includes a blower system to help ensure a minimum pressure can be provided to the circulator.  A multitool can be used to override the default setting if additional pressure is required.<BR>
<b>*Power required is proportional to the pressure differential to overcome. Ensure ample power is provided by SMES system, this is critical when an override active.
<li>Circulator efficiency will suffer if the pressure of the outlet exceeds the inlet*. This issue may also be mitigated by cycling gas from outlet near via auxilary ports or draining line pressure depending on loop configuration.<BR>
<b>*Failure to provide sufficient pressure will inhibit energy production until the problem can be rectified. </b><BR>
<li>Circulators are equipped with a lubrication system to aid with overall efficiency and longevity. Only lubricants with sufficiently high viscosity should be utilized. System should arrive pre-lubricated with a proprietary synthetic heavy hydrocarbon oil blend from the factory. Should additional lubricant be required or need changing carefully unscrew the maintenance panel to gain access.<BR>
<b>*Operation without sufficient lubricant may void your engine warranty but is unlikely to cause fire, explosion or death.</b><BR>
<li>With the power generation rate stable, engage charging of the superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices in the Power Room. Total charging input rates between all connected SMES cells must not exceed the available generator output.</ol>
<HR>
<i>Warning!</i> Improper engine and generator operation may cause exposure to hazardous gasses, extremes of heat and cold, and dangerous electrical voltages.
Only trained personnel should operate station systems. Follow all procedures carefully. Wear correct personal protective equipment at all times. Ensure that you know the location of all safety equipment before working.

		<li>1) A wrench can be used to change the shape of the lining. Currently only 6 shapes officially supported.</li>

		<li>3) Apply a standard multitool to change the pattern of the lining. If upon changing shape the pattern's value is higher than the maximum for that shape, the value gets automatically reset to 0.</li>
		<li>4) As this version is designed to be more flexible and compact, the lining feeds only on an internal power source. Due to this the only way to turn it off/on is to cut/mend the wires that connect to said power source.</li>
		<li>5) To adjust the lining's rotation, simply unscrew it from it's attachment point. The lining will automatically snap to the next available rotation and screw itself into a new attachment point.</li>
		<li>6) Due to safety concerns caused by our previous prototype of the product, the color change modules are only active when the lining is detached and thus in a coil.</li>
		<li>7) There have been reports that when the lining is in the short line shape, using a multitool to change the pattern sometimes triggers the movement function of it's rotation program. This essentially shifts the lining a bit. We understand that this might be a bit unintuitive, but since this isn't hazardous we have no intentions of fixing it.</li>

	Hello, dear customer!<hr>
	Pathogens can be scary! But you can rest easy knowing that your health is in safe hands now that you have contacted the CDC. Simply place a pathogen sample into the biohazard crate and send it back to us and we will have you cured in no time!<hr>
	<h3>How to send a pathogen sample</h3><hr>
	<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
		<li>1) Fill a reagent container with a blood sample from a person afflicted with the pathogen you are seeking to cure. (For instance, you could use the syringe we sent you!)</li>
		<li>2) Deposit reagent container into the received biohazard crate and close it.</li>
		<li>3) Send the biohazard crate back to us.</li>
		<li>4) As soon as we receive your sample, you can contact us using your Quartermaster's Console to ask us to start analyzing it.</li>
		<li>5) Once we are done analyzing your sample, we will offer to sell you cures. Buying a pack of multiple cures at a time will be cheaper for you!</li>
	</ul>
	We hope that you have found this pamphlet enlightening and we hope to receive your sample soon!<hr>
	Remember, only you can prevent deadly pathogens!

<h2>Your Lawbringer And You</h2>
<i>A Nanotrasen Arms Division Instructional Publication</i>
<hr>
<p>Welcome, noble lawperson, to the greatest technological development in policing since the helmet: Your new <b>Lawbringer™</b>!<br>
The Lawbringer™ is a multi-purpose self-recharging personal armament for our loyal Heads of Security.<br>
Please take a moment to acquaint yourself with your new colleague's features, and to scan your fingerprints into the provided identity lock system.</p>

<p>The Lawbringer™ is equipped with eight different Crime Pacification Projectile Synthesization Methods, or "Modes,"
all of which draw from the central Self-Renewing Energy Capacitance Device, or "Cell."<br> The Cell has a capacity of
300 Power Units ("PU"), and recharges at a rate of approximately 10 PU per 6 seconds;
however, due to the exacting measurements used in the Lawbringer™'s foolproof* design, the Cell
cannot be removed from the unit or externally recharged.<br>
<small><i><b>*</b>The Lawbringer™ should not be exposed to fools. If this occurs, wash thoroughly under cold water.</i></small></p>

<p>The greatest feature of the Lawbringer™ is its unique voice control system: To choose your desired Mode, simply speak its name!
So long as your fingerprints† match those assigned to the identity lock (configured during device setup) the Lawbringer™ will
automatically adopt your criminal control strategy of choice.<br>
<small><i><b>†</b>The user is considered responsible for the protection of their own fingerprints and arms.</i></small></p>
<hr>
<h3>Provided: A table of all Modes, their power drains, and their purposes.</h3>

<table border = "1" cellpadding = "3" cellspacing = "3">

<td><b>"Detain"</b></td>
<td>50 PU</td>
<td>The perfect crowd control option, this Mode stuns all your enemies within a close radius, but leaves you untouched!</td>

<td>Turn your Lawbringer™ into your favourite sidearm with these .38 Full Metal Jacket rounds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>"Hotshot"</b></td>
<td>60 PU</td>
<td>This handy flare gun/flamethrower option is sure to heat things up! The Lawbringer™ is not certified fireproof. Do not set on fire.</td>

</tr>

<i><b>*</b>Also accepted for this Mode: "High Explosive," "HE."</i>
<hr>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> Nanotrasen Arms Division cannot be held liable in the case of inconvenience, failure or death,
as per your Nanotrasen Employment Agreement. If any of the Modes are found to be ineffective, underpowered,
minimally successful at their purpose, or otherwise useless; and in the event that the user survives to do so;
Nanotrasen Arms Division requests that they submit a formal Suggestion to our company forums,
so that the Lawbringer™ can be the best it can be. Do not place fingers in path of moving parts, as the Lawbringer™ device
is solid-state and should not feature moving parts. Note that the Cell may experience spontaneous explosive overload when
exposed to overconfident outbursts on the part of individuals unqualifed to embody the law; in event of such explosion, run.
