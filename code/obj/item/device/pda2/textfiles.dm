<b>Nanotrasen Botanist's Employee Handbook</b><br>
An Assignment that'll Grow On You<hr>
<b>Chapter 1 - Introduction</b><br>
Congratulations on your assignment to Station Botanist aboard one of our twenty top of the line space stations. No crew can function well on an empty stomach, as we all know -
thus the importance of your assignment on the station to keep the larders and medicine cabinets stocked cannot be understated. In a nutshell, your specific duties include:<br>
<i><ul>
<li>Ensuring the station's food provisions are not depleted</li>
<li>Bolstering the station's supply of medicine with herbal crops</li>
<li>Performing research into plant genetics</li>
<li>Provide the Chef and Chemist with ingredients for their work</li>
<li>Perform all standard crewman duties alongside your assignment</li>
</ul></i>
Your designated area on the station is Hydroponics. Please consult the maps for the station you are posted to.<hr>
<b>Chapter 2 - Your Tools</b><br>
Cultivating crops is careful work, and many factors must be taken into consideration when growing and breeding plants. The standard Hydroponics room should be stocked with
several tools to help you carry out your assignment to the best of your ability. We will now review these tools and their correct operation.<br><br>
<u>Farmer Melons AgriPot Model 106.14</u><br>
The centerpiece of your work, a standard Hydroponics room contains sixteen of these pots, freshly cleaned and ready for use. The pots automatically fabricate a powdered
mixture of nutrients and minerals essential to sustain plant growth - all that is required is that water be added to the mixture on a regular basis to prevent the plant
from dehydrating. The pots will generally be pre-watered before every shift starts, so don't worry about adding more until prompted to do so - adding too much water to the
solution is known to dilute the mixture too much and stunt the plant's growth.<br>
Take note of the three LED lights on the base of the pot - these will indicate if the pot detects an occurrance which requires attention.
<i><ul>
<li>RED: The nutrient solution is too dry. Add water.</li>
<li>BLUE: The nutrient solution is too diluted. Add no further water.</li>
<li>GREEN: The plant has achieved maximum growth. Harvest your crops!</li>
</ul></i>
To begin growing something in one of the pots, simply plant a seed in it. Nature will do the rest, provided you keep the water level balanced!<br>
Please note that the high-nutrient composition of the soil makes it very sensitive to the presence of weeds, which will take root and thrive in the pot if their reproductive
material (fungal spores, airborne microseeds, etc) comes into contact with the solution. We recommend disposing of these various types of weed as soon as you are able.<br>
We will provide more in-depth information on plants and weeds later in this handbook.<br><br>
<u>Nanotrasen Dispensing Unit Mk1.5</u><br>
A standard Nanotrasen dispenser unit, loaded with a multitude of seeds for authorised crop types.<br>
We wish to remind crewmen that opening the device should only be performed when the device is in need of repairs, and then only by a qualified technician.<br><br>
<u>Farmer Melons Seed Extractor Model 102.04</u><br>
Invaluable in the efficient reproduction of plants, especially for genetic research, the Seed Extractor unit accepts one unit of seed-bearing fruit at a time, and will
carefully and slowly sift the item for viable seeds. The fruit will be consumed in the process, but the extractor is guaranteed to extract at least one seed from the item
of produce, preserving the plant's genetic build. This makes it a very useful tool when breeding plants.<br><br>
<u>Nanotrasen Standard Issue Watering Can</u><br>
This will be your primary tool for sustaining the hydration of growing plants. It comes pre-filled with plenty of water.<br><br>
<u>Farmer Melons Nutri-H Plantmix</u><br>
A rich nutrient slurry from Farmer Melons' processing plants, this will improve the health condition of plants - note however that this advanced mixture will cause the
soil in the pot to dry out a lot quicker - if you plan on using this, make sure you have a lot of water available.<br><br>
<u>Gen-Chem Labs Atrazine Weedkiller Compound</u><br>
A bottle containing the herbicidal compound Atrazine (nitrohychloride), it will selectively target particular types of plant and eliminate them from the inside
once absorbed through the soil, while remaining harmless to useful types of crop. Though it takes a short time to work, it is highly effective against weed infestations
of any kind.<br><br>
<u>Farmer Melons' GeneScan v2</u><br>
You will find two handheld units of these, however they are merely backups as your PDA should have a ScanCart installed.<br>
When used on a viable strain of plant, these will scan the genetic makeup of the plant and display a report on the genes relevant to plant breeding. These genes and what
to do with them will be discussed in a later chapter.<hr>
<b>Chapter 3 - Growing Crops</b><br>
The process of growing and harvesting plants is simple enough, for the most part:<br>
<ul>
<li>1) Obtain a seed from the Dispenser, and plant it in the Plant Pot.</li>
<li>2) If the red signal switches on, add water to the pot.</li>
<li>3) Periodically check the plant by hand for abnormalities.</li>
<li>4) Optionally, add compost to improve plant condition.</li>
<li>5) When the green signal switches on, harvest the produce.</li>
<li>6) Repeat until the plant reaches the end of its lifespan.</li>
</ul>
If you wish to breed plants, it may be wise to save at least one item of produce for the Seed Extractor.<br>
While plants are growing, it is prudent to keep checking both the plant itself and the surrounding pots. Certain chemicals can cause unstable or detrimental effects upon
a plant's health and genes. In particular you should avoid pouring unusual chemicals into the plantpots, and you should keep an eye on the other pots in the hydroponics room,
particularly for Creeper weeds which are an aggressive, fast-growing vine capable of spreading to other pots and killing other plants.<br>
The use of compost, while not vital to growing plants, is very helpful in improving the condition of a damaged plant or increasing the crop yield and lifespan of a plant.
Simply pour the compost into the plantpot to saturate the soil with rich nutrients - take note however that this will cause the water in the pot to dry out twice as quickly,
so if you wish to nurture a plant to good health then it would be wise to not stray far from the plant. Other forms of plant nutrients exist - co-operate with the chemist
and experiment to see if you can find nutrients with more potency or other beneficial effects to the standard issue compost.<hr>
<b>Chapter 3 - Plant Breeding</b><br>
Plant Scanners will be invaluable to you in this line of work. Using a plant scanner on a plant, fruit or seed will display information about mutable genes in this plant.
Different species may have different combinations of genes. Bear in mind that genes operate in concordance with the plant's normal values for it's species.
For instance, Melons normally produce two melons per harvest - a Yield gene of 1 means they would produce three. The most well-known genes are:
<ul>
<li>Maturation Rate - how quickly the plant matures from a sprout.</li>
<li>Production Rate - how quickly the plant produces a new harvest</li>
<li>Yield - how much the plant produces per harvest</li>
<li>Lifespan - how many harvests the plant can survive</li>
<li>Endurance - how resistant the plant is to damage</li>
<li>Potency - how powerful the produce of this plant is</li>
</ul>
With the exception of the Rates, higher numbers are better. Genes are passed down from plants to their fruits and seeds - when planted, a seed will mutate slightly from the
genes it already had. This is largely up to chance and any gene could be raised or lowered - experiment with various lineages and try to get as many seeds as possible if you
are breeding for a particular kind of gene.<hr>
