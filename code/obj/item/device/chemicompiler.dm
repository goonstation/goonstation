/**
 * Chemicompiler
 * v1.0 By volundr 9/24/14
 * This device is a programmable chemistry mixing and heating device.
 * The javascript code to run the frontend is in browserassets/js/chemicompiler.min.js
 *   which is minified javascript from browserassets/js/chemicompiler.js
 *   If you make changes to the uncompressed javascript, you'll need to install node.js,
 *   and run `npm install -g uglify-js`
 *   then run `uglifyjs browserassets/js/chemicompiler.js -c > browserassets/js/chemicompiler.min.js` to rebuild the compressed version.
