// a brief note from cirr:
// originally i wanted to make it so that this would also clone martian obj critters
// however it is giving me the worst headache and it seems like all it will do is cause outrage from players for adding difficulty to an already difficult area
// ergo, i'm stating that i did have this intention, but then i went "fuck it" and went back to mobs
// thanx for reading
