// WIP cloner defects

/// Concept: cloning you gives you wacky defects, which can be genetic, sci-fi, or just dumb space magic. If you're scanned while you have some cloner defects,
/// Those are also included in the scan, meaning after another cloning you'll be even more screwed up. However, curing defects before scanning (the curable ones, at least)
/// will mean they don't carry over.
/// Current concept is that defects will first be split into major/minor, and then weighted in those pools seperately.
///
/// Properties set in init() will only be ran/applied when the defect is initially added, not when the defect is applied after a later cloning.
/// Properties set in on_add() will be ran/applied on every further cloning, if not removed.
///
/// Applied when leaving the pod (via signal jank) rather than when starting the clone (to prevent us instantly botching the clone)
///
///
/// - This replaces the max health debuff, so the 'Quit Cloning Around' medal will need a new method. Maybe hitting a certain threshold of instability/defect score?


// OVERALL TODO

// --- CRUCIAL ---
// Actually tie this in to cloner code so people get cloner defects
// DONE - Implement random defect rolling (33% major 66% minor?)
// DONE - NO REMOVAL FOR NOW - Figure out where/how on_remove() will be called/how the conditions will be checked. Ton of new signals?
// DONE? - finish up cloner_defect_holder

// --- MINOR ---
// CURRENTLY UNNECESSARY Maybe add an on_life proc? Just using signals for now
// DONE Figure out how to make defects persist between clones; also, should it take defects at time of clone or at time of scan?
// PROBABLY NOT DOING THIS ACTUALLY - Add geometric dist for cloner defect add count with p=0.5

// --- BACKLOG ---
