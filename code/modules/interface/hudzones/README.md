# dynamic hud stuff

if you want to use this i strongly recommend looking at existing examples of how it's used
i also strongly recommend copying the hud_layout_template.png file
it is 21x15 (like widescreen mode) and you can colour in cells to show different hud zones
this makes it easier to see where things are in relation to eachother, since codewise its all coordinate pairs
and coordinate pairs are harder to intuit
