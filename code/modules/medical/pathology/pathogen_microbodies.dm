/**
 * Microbody notes
 *
 * A pathogen microbody identifies the cause of the disease.
 * Most of the real life causes for diseases have been added already.
 * Each microbody defines a specific characteristic for a pathogen:
 * - How powerful is a disease caused by the microbody (stages).
 * - What is a fertile soil to cultivate this pathogen? (growth medium)
 *
 *
 * We differentiate between two types of cures:
 * - Serum. Every microbody has a serum; there is nothing that is currently incurable. Of course not adding a cure for a specific
 *   microbody will make all pathogens of that microbody incurable.
 * - Vaccine. Currently, only virii have vaccines; injecting someone with a vaccine for a pathogen will make them immune to said
 *   pathogen and all its mutations. A traitor would use this for his very deadly airbourne pathogen to avoid getting infected
 *   by it.
