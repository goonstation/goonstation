<h1>Gravi-Tonne Tether Operator's Manual</h1>
<p><i>Draft Edition</i></p>
<hr>
<p>The Terra Nivium Gravi-Tonne wide-area gravity tether binds connected surfaces to a desired level of gravity.</p>
<p>This manual will show you how to operate the Gravi-Tonne tether and interpret its displays.</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<p>
First, unlock the unit by sliding your employee badge across the designated area by the keyboard.
Then use the keypad to enter your desired intensity* of gravity.
The values are relative to Earth gravity, so an entry of 0.5 would cause the tether to focus at half of Earth's gravity.
</p>

<p>After selecting the value, the internal capacitor will discharge and enable the gravity tether to </p>

<p>* <b>WARNING</b>: Fractional gravitational values can result in uncomfortable conditions, and may introduce gravity tremors.</p>

<h2>Indicators</h2>
<p>The front side of the Gravi-Tonne Tether has several indicators that allow for quick visual confirmation of the system status.</p>

<h3>Status Indicator</h3>
<p>The status indicators are located in the top-left area of the main front panel. The indicators can be one of four colors:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Green</b> indicates the system is providing gravity.</li>
	<li><b>Yellow</b> indicates the system is not providing gravity.</li>
	<li><b>Red</b> indicates the system is malfunctioning.</li>
	<li><b>Blue</b> indicates the tether is currently processing a shift in gravity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Charge Indicator</h3>
<p>The charging lights are located in the top-right area of the main front panel.</p>

<h3>Lock Indicator</h3>
<p>
The main input screen on the bottom-right area of the front main panel is the <b>system lock indicator</b>.
If green, the system is unlocked and the tether can be operated. If yellow, the system is locked and no input will be accepted.
</p>

<h3>Intensity Indicator</h3>
<p>The lighting along the left side of the unit displays the current intensity level.</p>

<h3>Histogram</h3>
<p>Across the middle of the front panel is a histogram that tracks local gravitational stability. A smooth curve indicates a stable gravitational field, while jagged marks may indicate gravitational distortion.</p>

<h4>Disruption Alert</h4>
When a local gravitational distortion is detected, the Gravi-Tonne Tether will play an alert sound.

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p><i>If you're unsure how or unable to service your Gravi-Tonne Tether, be sure to schedule an appointment with an Officially Licensed Gravi-Tonne Tether Technician today!</i></p>

<p>The Gravi-Tonne tether comes with a hinged, detachable front panel for ease of access to internal components. The tamper-resist security grate in the maintenance panel is automatically withdrawn when the system is placed in Unlocked Mode.</p>

<h3>Power Cell Replacement</h3>
<p>To replace the battery, first open the maintenance panel with a crowbar, then use a wrench to remove the internal power cell. Only replace with official TerraNivium Gravi-Tonne TM Unit Battery Replacent Cells</p>

<p>* <b>WARNING</b>:  Usage of unstable batteries may result in damage to the Gravi-Tonne Tether</p>

<h3>System Repair</h3>
<p>To repair your Gravi-Tonne Tether,  first remove the internal power cell as above. Then, cut out any damaged wiring and replace with fresh cables. You will need to re-calibrate the tether to the desired gravity level after it has been repaired.</p>
