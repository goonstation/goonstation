/// This code handles different lootpools for fishing
/// A fishing_lootpool is a datum that stores unified loottables for certain conditions on fishing
/// These loottables created in new()of a fishing spot and are added to a fishing spot.
/// These, in contrast to fishing spots, are NOT singletons, since they can be added and removed dynamically (for cases such as a fishing component)
/// Once someone tries to fish somewhere, proc/generate_fish iterate through all fishing_lootpools and generates a list to pick its fish from
/// Since fishing_lootpools have their own conditionals, this enables different loottables for e.g. different tier rods or other things such as baits
/// When adding loottables, is should be paid attention to that a loottable is avaible there.
