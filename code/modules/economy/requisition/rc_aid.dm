/**
 * Aid contracts are a class of standard (market-listed) contract.
 * Uniquely among contracts, aid contracts can't be pinned due to their urgency. Requirements and flavor text should convey this urgency.
 *
 * These should -usually- be fairly ordinary supplies that a fast-moving Quartermasters' office can scrounge up with relatively little aid.
 * Anything more difficult to respond to in short order, or prepare in advance, should yield significantly more cash.
