 * The primary datum for requisitions contracts.

 * Actual evaluation of contract entries occurs through requisition entries (/datum/rc_entry) contained within.
 * The contents of containers are evaluated sequentially, using the rc_eval proc of each entry that hasn't been fulfilled yet at time of evaluation.
 *
 * Fulfillment is managed internally within entries; the contract only cares about whether an item was needed, and whether the entry is satisfied.
 * You can have any sort of evaluation you like within new types of contract entry, as long as you're feeding back those two pieces of information.
 *
 * Contracts are divided by requisition class. Three market classes of requisition currently exist: Aid, Civilian and Scientific.
 * Each market cycle, these requisitions are refreshed, with at least one requisition from each category being present after the refresh.
 * These contract types have different requirements and sometimes an influence on what you can do with them. See individual files for more details.
 * Special requisition contracts also exist, shipped directly as a hard copy. These obey notably different rules, as described in rc_special.dm.
