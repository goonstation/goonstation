/* Overview:
The air_master global variable is the workhorse for the system.

Why are you archiving data before modifying it?
	The general concept with archiving data and having each tile keep track of when they were last updated is to keep everything symmetric
		and totally independent of the order they are read in an update cycle.
	This prevents abnormalities like air/fire spreading rapidly in one direction and super slowly in the other.

Why not just archive everything and then calculate?
	Efficiency. While a for-loop that goes through all tiles and groups to archive their information before doing any calculations seems simple, it is
		slightly less efficient than the archive-before-modify/read method.

Why is there a cycle check for calculating data as well?
	This ensures that every connection between group-tile, tile-tile, and group-group is only evaluated once per loop.
