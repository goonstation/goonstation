	info = {"<h4>Getting Started</h4>
	Congratulations, your station has purchased the H-87 industrial cloning device!<br>
	Using the H-87 is almost as simple as brain surgery! Simply insert the target humanoid into the scanning chamber and select the scan option to create a new profile!<br>
	<b>That's all there is to it!</b><br>
	<i>Notice, cloning system cannot scan inorganic life or small primates.  Scan may fail if subject has suffered extreme brain damage.</i><br>
	<p>Clone profiles may be viewed through the profiles menu. Scanning implants a complementary CLONING RECORDS IMPLANT into the subject, which may be viewed from the cloning console.
	Profile Deletion has been restricted to \[Station Head\] level access.</p>
	<h4>Cloning from a profile</h4>
	Cloning is as simple as pressing the CLONE option to the right of the desired profile.<br>
	Per your company's EMPLOYEE PRIVACY RIGHTS agreement, the H-87 has been blocked from cloning crewmembers while they are still alive.<br>
	<br>
	<p>The provided CLONEPOD SYSTEM will produce the desired clone.  Standard clone maturation times (with SPEEDCLONE technology) are roughly 90 seconds.
	The cloning pod may be unlocked early with any \[Medical Researcher\] ID after initial maturation is complete.</p><br>
	<i>Please note that resulting clones may have a small DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECT as a result of genetic drift.</i><br>
	<h4>Profile Management</h4>
	<p>The H-87 (as well as your station's standard genetics machine) can accept STANDARD DATA DISKETTES.
	These diskettes are used to transfer genetic information between machines and profiles.
	A load/save dialog will become available in each profile if a disk is inserted.</p><br>
	<i>A good diskette is a great way to counter aforementioned genetic drift!</i><br>

	All NanoTrasen spaceships are equipped with multiple cryogenics tubes, meant to store and heal critically wounded patients using cryoxadone. Use this guide for proper
	setup and handling instructions.<br><br>
	<h4>Setting Up the Cryogenics Chambers</h4>
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Secure a filled canister of O2 or another suitable air mixture to the attached connector using a wrench.</li>
	<li>Add a 50-unit supply of cryoxadone to each of the two cryogenics chambers. There should be two nearby beakers for this purpose; if they are missing or empty, it is recommended
	that a request be sent to the Research Department to synthesize an additional supply.</li>
	<li>Set the freezer to the lowest possible temperature setting (73.15 K, the default) if necessary.</li>
	<li>Turn on the power on the freezer and leave it on.</li>
	<li>One can add a defibrillator to attempt to revive subjects as well.</li>
	</ol>
	Note that the supply of cryoxadone will not deplete unless there is a patient present in the cryogenics chamber. However, the oxygen slowly depletes if the cryogenics chambers
	themselves are turned on, so it is recommended to leave them switched off unless a patient is present.<br><br>
	<h4>Treating a Patient Using the Cryogenics Chambers</h4>
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Stabilize the patient's health using CPR or cardiac stimulants.</li>
	<li>Remove any exosuit, headgear, and any other insulative materials being worn by the patient. Failure to remove these will deter the effects of the cryoxadone and halt the
	healing process.</li>
	<li>Check to ensure that the gas temperature is at optimal levels and there is no contamination in the system.</li>
	<li>Put the patient in the cryogenics chamber and turn it on.</li>
	</ol>
	The cryogenics chamber will automatically eject patients once their health is back to normal, but post-cryo evaluation is recommended nevertheless.

/obj/item/paper/courtroom
	name = "'A Crash Course in Legal SOP on SS13'"
	info = {"<B>Roles:</B><BR>\nThe Detective is basically the investigator and prosecutor.<BR>\nThe Staff Assistant can perform these functions with written
	authority from the Detective.<BR>\nThe Captain/HoP is the judicial authority.<BR>\nThe Security Officers are responsible for executing warrants,
	security during trial, and prisoner transport.
	<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Investigative Phase:</B><BR>\nAfter the crime has been committed the Detective's job is to gather evidence and try to ascertain not only who did
	it but what happened. They must take special care to catalogue everything and don't leave anything out.
	Write out all the evidence on paper. Make sure you take an appropriate number of fingerprints. If you must ask someone questions, you have permission to confront them.
	If the person refuses, the Detective can ask a judicial authority to write a subpoena for questioning. If again the suspect fails to respond then that person
	is to be jailed as insubordinate and obstructing justice. Said person will be released after they cooperate.
	<BR>\n<BR>\nONCE the Detective has a clear idea as to who the criminal is, they are to write an arrest warrant on the piece of paper.
	IT MUST LIST THE CHARGES. The Detective is to then go to the judicial authority and explain a small version of their case. If the case is moderately
	acceptable the authority should sign it. Security must then execute said warrant.
	<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Pre-Pre-Trial Phase:</B><BR>\nNow a legal representative must be presented to the defendant if said defendant requests one.
	That person and the defendant are then to be given time to meet (in the jail IS ACCEPTABLE). The defendant and their lawyer	are then to be given a copy of
	all the evidence that will be presented at trial (rewriting it all on paper is fine). THIS IS CALLED THE DISCOVERY PACK. With a few exceptions,
	THIS IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE BOTH SIDES MAY USE AT TRIAL. IF the prosecution will be seeking the death penalty it MUST be stated at this time. ALSO, if the defense will be
	seeking not guilty by mental defect, it must be stated this at this time to allow ample time for examination.
	<BR>\nNow at this time each side is to compile a list of witnesses.
	By default, the defendant is on both lists regardless of anything else. Also the defense and prosecution can compile more evidence beforehand BUT in order for it to be used
	the evidence MUST also be given to the other side.\nThe defense has time to compile motions against some evidence here.
	<BR>\n<B>Possible Motions:</B><BR>\n1.
	<U>Invalidate Evidence-</U> Something with the evidence is wrong and the evidence is to be thrown out. This includes irrelevance or corrupt Security.<BR>\n2.
	<U>Free Movement-</U> Basically, the defendant is to be kept uncuffed before and during the trial.<BR>\n3.
	<U>Subpoena Witness-</U> If the defense presents good reasons for needing a witness but said person fails to cooperate then a subpoena is issued.<BR>\n4.
	<U>Drop the Charges-</U> Not enough evidence is there for a trial so the charges are to be dropped. The Detective CAN RETRY but the judicial authority must carefully
	reexamine the new evidence.<BR>\n5.
	<U>Declare Incompetent-</U> The defendant is insane. Once this is granted, a medical official is to examine the patient. If they are indeed insane, they are to be placed
	under care of the medical staff until they are deemed competent to stand trial.
	<BR>\n<BR>\nALL SIDES MOVE TO A COURTROOM<BR>\n
	<B>Pre-Trial Hearings:</B><BR>\nA judicial authority and the 2 sides are to meet in the trial room.
	NO ONE ELSE BESIDES A SECURITY DETAIL IS TO BE PRESENT. The defense submits a plea. If the plea is guilty, then proceed directly to sentencing phase.
	Now the sides each present their motions to the judicial authority. The judicial authority rules on them. Each side can debate each motion. Then the judicial authority
	gets a list of crew members. The judicial authority first gets a chance	to look at them all and pick out acceptable and available jurors. Those jurors are then called over.
	Each side can ask a few questions and dismiss jurors they find too biased. HOWEVER, before dismissal the judicial authority MUST agree to the reasoning.
	<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>The Trial:</B><BR>\nThe trial has three phases.<BR>\n1.
	<B>Opening Arguments</B> - Each side can give a short speech. They may not present ANY evidence.<BR>\n2.
	<B>Witness Calling/Evidence Presentation</B> - The prosecution goes first and is able to call the witnesses on their approved list in any order.
	They can recall them if necessary. During the questioning the lawyer may use the evidence in the questions to help prove a point.
	After every witness, the other side has a chance to cross-examine. After both sides are done questioning a witness the prosecution can present another witness or recall one
	(even the EXACT same one again!). After prosecution is done the defense can call witnesses. After the initial cases are presented both sides are free to call witnesses on either
	list.<BR>\nFINALLY once both sides are done calling witnesses we move onto the next phase.<BR>\n3.
	<B>Closing Arguments</B>- Same procedure as Opening Arguments.<BR>\nThe jury then deliberates IN PRIVATE. THEY MUST ALL AGREE on a verdict.
	REMEMBER: They can mix between some charges being guilty and others not guilty (IE, if you supposedly killed someone with a gun and you	unfortunately picked up a gun without
	authorization then you CAN be found not guilty of murder BUT guilty of possession of illegal weaponry). Once they have agreed, they present	their verdict. If unable to reach
	a verdict and feel they never will, they call a deadlocked jury and we restart at Pre-Trial phase with an entirely new set of jurors.
	<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Sentencing Phase:</B>
	<BR>\nIf the death penalty was sought (you MUST have gone through a trial for death penalty) then skip to the second part.
	<BR>\nI. Each side can present more evidence/witnesses in any order. There is NO ban on emotional aspects. The prosecution is to submit a suggested penalty.
	After all the sides are done, then the judicial authority is to give a sentence.
	<BR>\nII. The jury stays and does the same thing as I. Their sole job is to determine if the death penalty is applicable. If NOT then the judge selects a
	sentence.<BR>\n<BR>\nTADA you're done. Security then executes the sentence and adds the applicable convictions to the person's record.<BR>\n"}

Standard checklist for thermo-electric generator cold-start:
<HR>
<ol>
<li>Perform visual inspection of the <b>HOT (left)</b> and <b>COLD (right)</b> coolant-exchange pipe loops. Weld any breaks or cracks in the pipes before continuing.
<li>Connect one Plasma canister to a cooling loop supply port with a wrench, and open the adjacent supply valve.
<li>Connect one Plasma canister to a heating loop supply port with a wrench, and open the adjacent supply valve.<BR>
<i>Note:</i> Observe standard canister safety procedures. Additional canisters may be utilized or mixed together for various thermodynamic effects. CO2 and N2 can be effective moderators.
<li>Open the main gas supply valves on both loops, the core inlet and outlet valves on both loops, and the combustion chamber bypass valve on the hot loop.<BR>
<i>If you wish to use the supplemental combustion chamber instead of or in addition to the furnaces, close the bypass and open the inlet and outlet valves above it.</i><BR>
<li>Coolant supply and exchange pump settings can be adjusted from the Control Room.<BR>
<li>Load the furnaces with char ore and activate them. Reload as needed. Plasmastone and various other materials may be used as well.
<li>Heat can be provided by the furnaces, the gas combustion chamber, or in experimental setups, direct combustion of pipe coolant*.<BR>
<b>*Direct combustion of internal coolant may void your engine warranty and result in: fire, explosion, death, and/or property damage.</b><BR>
<li>In the event of hazardous coolant pressure buildup, use the vent valves in maintenance above the engine core to drain line pressure. If the engine is not functioning properly, check your line pressure.
<li>Generator efficiency may suffer if the pressure differential between loops becomes too high. This may be rectified by adding more gas pressure to the low side or draining the high side.
<li>The circulator includes a blower system to help ensure a minimum pressure can be provided to the circulator.  A multitool can be used to override the default setting if additional pressure is required.<BR>
<b>*Power required is proportional to the pressure differential to overcome. Ensure ample power is provided by SMES system, this is critical when an override is active.</b><BR>
<li>Circulator efficiency will suffer if the pressure of the outlet exceeds the inlet*. This issue may also be mitigated by cycling gas from outlet near via auxilary ports or draining line pressure depending on loop configuration.<BR>
<b>*Failure to provide sufficient pressure will inhibit energy production until the problem can be rectified.</b><BR>
<li>Circulators are equipped with a lubrication system to aid with overall efficiency and longevity. Only lubricants with sufficiently high viscosity should be utilized. System should arrive pre-lubricated with a proprietary synthetic heavy hydrocarbon oil blend from the factory. Should additional lubricant be required or need changing carefully unscrew the maintenance panel to gain access.<BR>
<b>*Operation without sufficient lubricant may void your engine warranty but is unlikely to cause fire, explosion or death.</b><BR>
<li>With the power generation rate stable, engage charging of the superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices in the Power Room. Total charging input rates between all connected SMES cells must not exceed the available generator output.</ol>
<HR>
<i>Warning!</i> Improper engine and generator operation may cause exposure to hazardous gasses, extremes of heat and cold, and dangerous electrical voltages.
Only trained personnel should operate station systems. Follow all procedures carefully. Wear correct personal protective equipment at all times. Ensure that you know the location of all safety equipment before working.

	<h3>Operating Singularity Buster rocket launcher</h3><hr>
	<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
		<li>1) Carefully pick up a singularity buster rocket and load it into the loading chamber of the rocket launcher. Please make sure not to hit the rocket
		on any hard surfaces while doing so as this may lead to matter destabilization. </li>
		<li>2) Pick up the rocket launcher on your shoulders, yet again making sure not to hit the rocket launcher on any hard surfaces as this might accidentally
		disintegrate the weapon.</li>
		<li>3) Point the rocket launcher carefully towards the center of a rogue singularity.</li>
		<li>4) Press the trigger and prepare for the rocket to fly out of the barrel. This might be a good moment to pray for your safety if you are into that
		kind of thing as there is a slight chance for the rocket to destabilize and cause a new singularity to appear in its location. </li>

	<h3>Product description</h3><hr>
	Ever wanted to spice up your bar? Build a meditation room? Enhance the station halls in case of an emergency? Then this official Nanotrasen neon lining
	is what you need. Now with color-change modules!<hr>
	<h3>Modifying the neon lining</h3><hr>
	<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
		<li>1) A wrench can be used to change the shape of the lining. Currently only 6 shapes are officially supported.</li>
		<li>2) To turn an already attached piece of lining back into a coil, carefully use a crowbar to detach it from its attachment point.</li>
		<li>3) Apply a standard multitool to change the pattern of the lining. If upon changing shape, the pattern's value is higher than the maximum for that shape,
		the value gets automatically reset to 0.</li>
		<li>4) As this version is designed to be more flexible and compact, the lining feeds only on an internal power source. Due to this the only way to turn it
		off/on is to cut/mend the wires that connect to said power source.</li>
		<li>5) To adjust the lining's rotation, simply unscrew it from its attachment point. The lining will automatically snap to the next available rotation and
		screw itself into a new attachment point.</li>
		<li>6) Due to safety concerns caused by our previous prototype of the product, the color-change modules are only active when the lining is detached and thus in a coil.</li>
		<li>7) There have been reports that when the lining is in the short line shape, using a multitool to change the pattern sometimes triggers the movement function. This
		essentially shifts the lining a bit. We understand that this might be a bit unintuitive, but since this isn't hazardous we have no intentions of fixing it.</li>

	Long story short they tried to jam the thing in there and cracked some bit or another and now the thing wont work.<br>

	Redoing the uplink system would be a hassle. I think an interface change might do the trick though.<br>
	I'll go ahead and relabel their uplinks to show some abstract representation of credits.<br>
	Is it accurate? No - its still telecrystals under the hood. But it should stop any more confusion and<br>

	<hr>
	<p>Welcome, noble lawperson, to the greatest technological development in policing since the helmet: Your new <b>Lawbringer™</b>!<br>
	The Lawbringer™ is a multi-purpose self-recharging personal armament for our loyal Heads of Security.<br>
	Please take a moment to acquaint yourself with your new colleague's features, and to scan your fingerprints into the provided identity lock system.</p>

	<p>The Lawbringer™ is equipped with eight different Crime Pacification Projectile Synthesization Methods, or "Modes,"
	all of which draw from the central Self-Renewing Energy Capacitance Device, or "Cell."<br> The Cell has a capacity of
	300 Power Units ("PU"), and recharges at a rate of approximately 10 PU per 6 seconds;
	however, due to the exacting measurements used in the Lawbringer™'s foolproof* design, the Cell
	cannot be removed from the unit or externally recharged.<br>
	<small><i><b>*</b>The Lawbringer™ should not be exposed to fools. If this occurs, wash thoroughly under cold water.</i></small></p>

	<p>The greatest feature of the Lawbringer™ is its unique voice control system: To choose your desired Mode, simply speak its name!
	So long as your fingerprints† match those assigned to the identity lock (configured during device setup) the Lawbringer™ will
	automatically adopt your criminal control strategy of choice.<br>
	<small><i><b>†</b>The user is considered responsible for the protection of their own fingerprints and arms.</i></small></p>

	<b>Congratulations for purchasing the Syndicate Rapid-Deployment Remote (SRDR)!</b><br><br>
	To use it, first of all, you need to either be onboard the Cairngorm or at the Listening Post. <br>
	Once you're there, activate the SRDR in-hand to choose a location, then once more to teleport everyone (along with any nuclear devices you possess)
	within 4 tiles of you to the forward assault pod, at which point it will begin head to the station, taking about one minute.
	During this time, Space Station 13's sensors will indicate the quickly-arriving pod, and will likely warn the crew. <br>
	Once the minute ends, everyone will be deployed to the specified area through personnel missiles.

	SUBJECT: Imminent Closure<br>
	----------------------------------------<br>
	Dearest friends,<br><br>

	It is my great displeasure to inform you all of the imminent cessation of financial support from the Station Morale
	Organization to all performing arts activities due to budgetary constraints. This therefore means that the NanoTrasen
	Marching Band will have to close down and stop paying all of its employees.<br><br>

	Off the record, what BUFFOONISH bean-counter cut off our funding?! Do they not know how IMPORTANT the arts are in
	maintaining our collective sanity in this HELLHOLE of a station?! For Capital-G God's sake, I spend forty hours a
	day in the engine room, is it so hard to spare us but one of those hours doing something, ANYTHING to keep us from
	resorting to savagery?! So what if our uniforms make us look like dorks and that half the crew wish to puncture their
	eardrums, music is all I have, all that ANY of us have!<br><br>

	You know what, these bastards don't even deserve us. I'm out of here.<br><br>

	Yours faithfully,<br><br>

	Ovidius Gotdam<br>
	NT Marching Band Director

	Donut 2 SMES Units and YOU<br><br>

	A full guide to ensuring the station is powered up properly<br>
	----------------------------------------<br><br>
	Howdy Engineer, so you just set up this here SMES unit and you think you're done? Boy howdy do I have some news for you!<br><br>

	This here station has not just ONE, not just TWO, but FOUR SMES units set up to power up the entire main station. You might be thinking, 'So,
	Ms. Mysterious Engineer Who Knows Way More Than I Do, what does that mean?'<br><br>

	WELL! It means there's four SMES units and four power grids on the station! Finding them is pretty damn simple if I do say so myself, all you
	gotta do is walk around the inner loop of maintenance and find the SMES rooms. There's one just east of medbay, one just below arrivals and QM
	and one direction west of the bridge! Oh, there's also, uhh, you know, the one in Engineering.<br><br>

	Once you've got those four SMES units set you're all good. The singularity is a MARVEL of modern engineering and produces near ENDLESS power!<br><br>

	Oh, couple small things to add. There are a few solar panel groups in outer maintenance, but they're not wired to power the whole station at once
	so you would have to connect the four grids if you wanted, or needed, to run the station that way. Research Outpost Zeta also has its own solar
	panel setup, but it comes preconfigured and should last them well through any single shift, so you don't gotta worry about that none.<br><br><br>

	Keep that power flowing,<br>
	S.L.

	How to build a set up a new mining magnet<br><br>

	A basic guide to construction a new mineral magnet for your mining operation<br>
	----------------------------------------<br><br>
	Thank you for purchasing your standard Mineral Magnet.<br>
	The following instructions should help you get your new mineral magnet constructed and configured properly.<br>
	If any of these steps are already completed you may skip them.<br><br>

	1. Build a border around the intended mining area with magnet chassis on the edge facing into mining area.<br>
	NOTE: Internal magnet area must be either 7x7 for the small size magnet or 15x15 for normal size magnet. Border must not be part of the internal magnet area.<br><br>


	2. Assemble magnet chassis outside of internal mining area and mining area border, facing the mining area.<br><br>

	3. Use mineral magnet parts on the magnet chassis to construct the mineral magnet.<br><br>

	4. Assemble mineral magnet control computer somewhere nearby that has power available.<br><br>

	5. Retrieve Magnetizer device and ensure it is loaded with raw plasmastone.<br><br>

	6. Link Magnetizer with assembled mineral magnet.<br><br>

	7. Go to bottom left area of internal magnet area and use magnetizer on the bottom left corner<br>
	NOTE: Must be the internal magnet area, not the border of the magnet area.<br><br>

	Congrats! Your mineral magnet is now assembled and ready for use!
