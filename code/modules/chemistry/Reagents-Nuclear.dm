/*
	vars:
		nuke_compat: 1 to mark reagent as suitable for nuclear reactor input. all reagents in this file should set this
		fissile: 1 if reagent emits particle radition suitable for fission-type reactions. "is it nuclear fuel"
		part_type: emission particle type. currently only 'neutron' is valid
		epv: emissivity per volume unit -- rate at which particles emit per mass (err, "vol") unit
		hpe: heat generated per emission -- rate at which heat is generated per scalar emission amount
		absorb: percentage of incoming particle flux absorbed -- 1.0 = perfect particle shield, 0 = vaccum
		k_factor: criticality factor, rate at which new particles are generated/emitted per particle absorbtion. "The six factor formula effective neutron multiplication factor"
		products: list of byproducts created when parent reagent undergoes fission. requires products_r
		products_r: percentage at which the above byproducts are created. 1-to-1, must match index of above. requires products
