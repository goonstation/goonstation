		src.fields["basics1"] = "DWAINE is a multi-user Unix-like operating system produced by Thinktronic Data Systems.  The primary user interface is through a text-based terminal shell.|nApplications may be invoked simply by typing their filename, followed by a list of arguments if necessary.  A set of primary commands, those covering basic system tasks (Such as ls and cd), are made available to all users regardless of location in the filesystem.  Otherwise, applications must be in the user's current working directory to run."
		src.fields["basics2"] = "Directory navigation is accomplished primarily through the ls and cd commands.|nLS, an abbreviation of \"list\" will list the contents of the current directory.  The argument -l will cause it to also display extended file information and hidden files.|nCD, or \"change directory\" will set the current directory to the provided path, if valid.  A filepath takes a form such as \"/mnt/drive0\"  Paths starting with / descend from the root directory  \"..\" refers to the directory one level up from the current, while \".\" refers to the current directory.|nEx: \"cd ../hams\" would specify a directory named ham with the same parent as the current working one."
		src.fields["basics3"] = "DWAINE is, primarily, a networked system.  All devices, from user terminals to lineprinters and tape drives, are connected remotely to the central mainframe.  Devices that interact with files, such as drives or printers, may appear as part of the filesystem as a sub-directory of /mnt.|nFor example, the contents of tape databank \"Main\" would appear within /mnt/main and applications and other files could be accessed by setting it to your working directory with \"cd /mnt/main\""
		src.fields["basics4"] = "Application software is often bundled with a \"readme\" file of some sort, which can be viewed with the CAT command.|nEx: \"cat readme\" will view the contents of a readme file in the user's working directory."
		src.fields["ls"] = "View contents of a directory.  If no filepath is supplied, the working directory will be listed.|nExpanded file information, as well as hidden files, may be viewed through use of the -l argument.|nUsage: ls \[-l] \[filepath]"

If the piping target is not an executable, an attempt will be made to write to that file.|nUsage: echo \"text\" OR echo \"text\" | pipe_file_name"
		src.fields["eval"] = "Evaluate an expression.  Stack based with RPN input--the operation is expressed following the inputs, like \"1 2 +\" will result in 3.|nInput values are placed in order in a \"stack,\" with most recent input on top and first input on the bottom.  Values are taken back off the stack from the top down.  Operations act on the top 1 or 2 values on the stack, usually removing them and placing the result as the new top.|nValid operations are +, -, *, /, %, for arithmetic operations.|neq (equal), neq (not equal), gt (greater than), ge (greater or equal), lt (less than), le (less or equal) for comparison operations,|nAnd, Or, Not, and Xor for logical operations.|nThe operator DUP will copy the top value on the stack without removing anything from the stack.|nText surrounded by apostrophes will be interpreted as a string.  Variables may be set by pushing the desired value to the stack and then using the TO operator and a variable name.  For example, \"5 to HAMDAD\" would create a variable with the name HAMDAD and value 5.|nThere are also four file checking operators: d, e, f, and x.  Each take a filepath string from the top of the stack and leave a boolean value in its place.  d leaves a true if the path is to a folder, x is true if the path is to an executable, f is true if the path is to a file, and e is true if the path is to anything at all."

File permissions take the form of three octal digits in the order of: owner, group, any user.|nBit one (The least significant bit) of each field controls modify access, bit two controls write access, and the third bit controls read access.|nUsage: chmod \"access value, i.e 777\" \"filename\""
