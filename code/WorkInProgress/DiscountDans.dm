/* Idea stuff here

	Hey Cathy,

	Don't you think we should ditch those clunky cans for the Peach Punch, and go with something more eco-friendly to suit our image?
	Maybe biodegradeable juice boxes or something equally cute? I'm sure the space hippies would love it. They'd probably give it to their kids, too.
	We could probably market it as some effort to help reduce waste and save the our space stations. Everyone likes Delightful Dan's. I'm sure we'd get good publicity.

	Priscilla

	Pris,

	Good idea. Bring it up during our next meeting, and I'll back you. Cyborg Sigma-89's still doing inspections, so you'll have to really sell it and pretend like you actually care about this shit.

	Cathy Gladys
	cgladys@delightfuldans
	Delightful Dan's Central Division General Manager

	Hi Cathy,

	Did you hear about what happened to that guy that ate our galaxy donuts? They said he grew like ten extra limbs all over the place and can't even properly talk to his lawyer. Something about radiation?

	Priscilla

	Pris,

	Shut the hell up. You know you're not supposed to talk about this.

	Cathy Gladys
	cgladys@delightfuldans
	Delightful Dan's Central Division General Manager

	Pris,

	Decirprevo claims that we copied their label design for our ginger ale. That's bullshit, right? Didn't you say that you commissioned it from some artist type?

	Cathy Gladys
	cgladys@delightfuldans
	Delightful Dan's Central Division General Manager

	About that... Can we meet up and talk?

	Priscilla

	You are so in trouble. You better make it good.

	Cathy Gladys
	cgladys@delightfuldans
	Delightful Dan's Central Division General Manager

	Hi all,

	Have you seen my mug around somewhere? It's the orange high-capacity one, the one I always use for coffee. I thought I had just left it at home or something, but when I checked, it wasn't anywhere. But I doubt someone would steal it. It's old... And kinda gross, to be honest? Anyways, please let me know if you see it, or just put in back in my office cabinet.

	Thanks a bunch,

	Monica

	Hey Cathy,

	Did you hear about what happened with Sam? Some idiot from NanoTrasen sent him a record for his collection, but it actually contained a song entirely out of farts! Honestly it's kinda hilarious, but apparently he's gone to visit that guy's station and file a complaint. He was muttering about smashing that record on that guy's head, too. I hope he doesn't get arrested for assault or something. Or, maybe, I do hope so. That might convince the board to give me his position. And maybe even a corner office like you have...

	Priscilla

	Priscilla,

	I will do everything in my capacity to help you secure a promotion. You're a valuable asset and a hard worker. That being said, I do think it's rather indecent of you to be scheming for a coworker's job. We are a team, here at Delightful Dan's, and I must ask you to respect me and my position and how I got here. Let's set up a meeting for when I get back to HQ.

	Best,

	Samuel Sterling
	ssterling@delightfuldans
	Delightful Dan's Central Division Deputy General Manager

	Hi Sam,

	I am so incredibly sorry! I have no idea what made me write such a horrible email to you! I must not have had enough tea. Please excuse me, and please don't take what I said so seriously! It was a genuine mistake and I deeply apologize.

	Priscilla

	Pris,

	We're getting harassed by some nosey activists. Save the sea unicorns or whatever bullshit. Like, seriously dude, we have a license and everything. Calm the fuck down. The sea's already fucked up and some more sewage won't make it worse. Can you figure out a way to stop them from picketing and clogging up our lines and all that shit? It's seriously affecting my ability to concentrate on my work!

	Cathy Gladys
	cgladys@delightfuldans
	Delightful Dan's Central Division General Manager

	Hi Cathy,

	Of course! I'll talk to them and let it slip that Grones Soda is illegally stealing piss to bottle. It should be enough to get them off our case.

	Priscilla

	Red and yellow just don't go well together, you know? It's like ketchup and mustard - they look disgusting together even if they taste delicious on a soy hotdog.

	Milo,

	For the love of all things good and holy, please please please
