	Caution should also be taken to make sure that the jetpack is fully operational and is turned on.

	that these junction boxes have a tendency to malfunction from time to time, but Nanotrasen is unable to confirm this issue at this time. If repairs must be done on the said junction boxes, insulating gloves are recommended.

	It should be noted that NSS Manta also uses vast amounts of power to stay on the move, to power its shields and to run other normal functions onboard. To help with this task, NSS Manta is equipped with an experimental singularity engine which while unstable, is easily able to
	keep NSS Manta powered for even the longest of voyages."}
