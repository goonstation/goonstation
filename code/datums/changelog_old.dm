(*)Enabled the new-type cyborgs as a test. Some stuff may be substantially different!
(*)Cyborg construction for new-type cyborgs is a bit different. The brain goes in the head piece before attaching, you use a wrench on the frame once it's complete to activate the new cyborg.
(*)After you've opened a Cyborg (crowbar) and exposed it's wires (screwdriver), use robot parts on it to attach new parts, or a wrench to remove existing ones.
(*)Treads are now available as a cyborg component. They occupy both leg slots - they boost speed a bit but drain power from the cyborg's cell.
(*)New type Cyborgs may get a free upgrade depending on which module they pick at the start. Mining Borgs also have the option to teleport to the mining station.
