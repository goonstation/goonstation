/** Disjoint Turf Connections
	This allows for a way of treating non-contigious turfs as if they were adjacent.  This provides for interoperability between
	z-levels or different sections of the map without having to connect everything physically.

	Turfs have an associative list of [/datum/disjoint_turf].  The keys are intended to be conceptual connections between the turfs such as
	"up", "down", "underfloor", that way they could be isolated or referred to later.atom

	Each [/datum/disjoint_turf] then has a number of connections types, which define the types of connections allowed, and a number of turfs
	they are connected to.
