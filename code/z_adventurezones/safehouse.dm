		<br> The company I represent understands that your time is valuable,
		<br> and that the potential time lost accrued from fatal events
		<br> are an overhead you just can't ignore. We want to prove
		<br> ourselves to industry leaders such as yourself by showing you
		<br> first-hand just what our product can do.
		<br>
		<br> Our new range of cloners integrates our HealthScan implant
		<br> line with packet protocols, seamlessly transferring the
		<br> mind from host to clone with near-zero loss of continuity
		<br> in the case of any fatal events.
		<br>
		<br> Please find enclosed a small advance to cover any expenses you
		<br> may have whilst you consider the offer. I hope to hear from
		<br> you soon.
		<br>
		<br> Best regards,
