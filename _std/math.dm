/**
	* provides the bit at a position (starting from 0) in a binary number
	* example: `EXTRACT_BIT(9, 1)`
	*
	* 9 in binary is `1001`
	* if i want to check the value of the 2nd bit in 9, i would use a value of 1 for position
	* this is because binary numbers start at 0 and bits are counted from right to left
	* then the << operator shifts that bit a number of bits to the left
	* in this case, it shifts it 1 bit to the left, turning 1 into 10 (in binary)
	* so what the macro looks like now (in binary) is `1001 & 0010`
	* the binary and operator (&) multiplies the values of the bits together
	* so doing `1001 & 0010` returns a value of `0000`
	* this tells us that the 2nd bit of `1001` is 0 (off)
	* if we did this with 11 (`1011`) instead, it would be `1011 & 0010`, which would return `0010`, which tells us that the 2nd bit of `1001` is 1 (on)
