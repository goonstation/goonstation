// -------------------------
// Every gang tag can provide anywhere between 0-6 * GANG_TAG_POINTS_PER_HEAT per GANG_TAG_SCORE_INTERVAL.
// You can therefore estimate how many points a gang might have using this, A VERY successful gang may see mostly level 4 tags.
//
// Giving a gang 2 more spray bottles will therefore mean 2 more level 3~4 tags,
// about 3.5*GANG_TAG_POINTS_PER_HEAT points every GANG_TAG_SCORE_INTERVAL
// Use this to figure if something is too valuable/expensive!
//
// MATH FOR NERDS:
// https:// www.desmos.com/calculator/p9uv6debrp
// This works out to roughly:
// Having the hottest tag gets level '5'
// Having 63% of the top heat is level '4'
// Having 40% of the top heat is level '3'
// Having 25% of the top heat is level '2'
// Having 10% of the top heat is level '1'
// Having less than 10% is level '0'
