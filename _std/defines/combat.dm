 * Special case grab for limbs which grab 'aggressively' immediately, but don't want to pull the person to their tile like a neck grab would.
 * Allows you to do 'aggressive' maneuvers like throwing people or suplexing them, but people can still just walk out of the grab.
 * Most mobs skip this step entirely; only limbs which use it as a base use it at all.
