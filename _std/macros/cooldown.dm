	* # Simple Cooldown System
	* Easy way to set cooldowns on an object.
	*
	* Arguments:
	* * COOLDOWN_OWNER: The object to store the cooldown data on. Can be `global`.
	* * ID: The specific ID of the cooldown, ex. "ahelp"
	* * DELAY: The amount of time(ds) that you want the cooldown to last.
	*
	* Usage:
	* ```
	*	if(!ON_COOLDOWN(global, "butt_talker", src.butt_cooldown))
	*		speak(pick("butts", "butt"))
	* ```
