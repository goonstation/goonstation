What does it change? What other things could this impact? -->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it so some stuff made out of mauxite uses unique sprites instead of the material color being applied to the base. This includes:\r\n\r\n- Walls + Rwalls\r\n- Floors (Though floors with non-default patterns will currently use the patterned sprite. Might need to be fixed idk?)\r\n- Lockers\r\n- Stools\r\n- Material sheets, rods, floortiles (Currently doesn't work, needs some code fix that I dunno how to do)\r\n- Chairs\r\n- Tables\r\n\r\nAlso change the default mauxite color to match these sprites\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041726307584704532/1064805967025426492/image.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041726307584704532/1064802683313209394/image.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why's this needed? <!-- Describe why you think this should be added to the game. -->\r\n\r\nI think this is a fun way to implement new building options, while also giving some aesthetic values to materials. Mauxite is just an arbitrary 'first' thing to work on, I plan to (and others can also) add stuff for other appropriate building materials, so you can have lots of options and uses for all the stuff mining can procure. Also the rusty industrial look could be useful for some prefabs which I've seen mentioned/been asked about on discord. \r\n\r\nWorks with the new fancy $$ material tag stuff that Amy coded and pali helped me out with. Very strong and useful toolkit for making this kinda stuff with more or less no additional code.\r\n\r\n## Changelog <!-- If necessary, put your changelog entry below. Otherwise, /please/ delete this entire section. -->\r\n<!-- Put how you want to be credited in the changelog in place of CodeDude. -->\r\n<!-- Use (*) for major changes and (+) for minor changes. See the contributor guide for details. For example: -->\r\n\r\n```changelog\r\n(u)Flaborized\r\n(+)Added unique sprites for many construct-able things made out of mauxite sheets, for that industrial warehouse look. Includes walls, floors, tables, and chairs. Go build stuff with it! Mind the rust.\r\n```\r\n",
