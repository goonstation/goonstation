What does it change? What other things could this impact? -->\r\nsorry, zjd. i loved pathology too, i'm hurt too.\r\n\r\nThe Pathology Lab on Cogmap 1 has been ripped out and replaced with a new medical wing. Contained within it is a new Psychiatrist's Office, Medical Podbay, and (at the suggestion of Cogwerks) an incinerator.\r\n\r\n![An image of the remapped southern section of Medbay.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66253095/212890149-9c5be92b-865f-4452-af9d-c5072afc3e71.png)\r\n\r\nSome other things were changed to accommodate the new space:\r\n- The south end of the Medbay Staff ARea has been expanded a little to accommodate a door into the Psychiatrist's Office. The sink has been moved as part of this.\r\n- The ante-room/decontamination area that once acted as the entrance for Pathology has been embiggened. The disposal chute inside has been moved to the main hallway, and the area also acts as a waiting area for the Psychiatrist's Office and a storage area for the wheelchairs.\r\n  - There now exists a door from the ante-room to the Treatment Center.\r\n- The mass-driver system (part of belt-hell) on the south has been moved two tiles down to provide sufficient clearance for the Medical Podbay doors.\r\n\r\n## Why's this needed? <!-- Describe why you think this should be added to the game. -->\r\nGiven that there are ongoing efforts to excise Pathology as a mechanic and as a sub-department from the maps in rotation, these changes seem appropriate. The additions of a Psychiatrist's Office and Podbay are intended to fill the gaps that can be felt on Cog1 compared to other maps on rotation; that being the absence of these facilities.\r\n\r\n## Changelog <!-- If necessary, put your changelog entry below. Otherwise, /please/ delete this entire section. -->\r\n<!-- Put how you want to be credited in the changelog in place of CodeDude. -->\r\n<!-- Use (*) for major changes and (+) for minor changes.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n```changelog\r\n(u)DisturbHerb\r\n(*)Cogmap 1's Pathology Lab has been replaced by a wing containing a Psychiatrist's Office and Podbay.\r\n```\r\n",
